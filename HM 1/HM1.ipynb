       " \"After missing the last two weeks with a severely sprained neck, the fearless shooting guard returned Saturday and scored 24 points, knocked down three 3-pointers, made 13 of 14 free throws, dished out a career-high nine assists and led the Bulldogs to an 83-71 victory over Temple. Welcome back, kid.\\n  \\t''It felt really good. When something like that happens, it puts a lot of things in perspective,'' Clarke said. ''I felt pretty normal.''\\n  \\tFor most of the day, he looked like his old self, too.\\n  \\tClarke repeatedly sent 3-pointers over the outstretched arms of defenders, confounding and frustrating them at the same time.\\n  \\tHe drove relentlessly through the lane, crashing hard to the floor once in each half. Yes, it brought back memories of that Jan. 12 play at Dayton when he crashed head first into a padded basket support head first and then stayed down for eight minutes before being taken off on a stretcher. On Saturday, Clarke, thankfully, bounced up right away both times as he continued to play his way.\\n  \\tAnd when Temple (13-6, 2-3 Atlantic 10) dared to chase Clarke with extra defenders, Clarke had no trouble finding teammates who were willing and able to knock down open shots.\\n  \\tIt was a far cry from how the Bulldogs (16-3, 4-1) played in Wednesday's loss at La Salle, their only defeat since Nov. 21. Butler has won 14 of 15, including three wins that came with Clarke on the bench.\\n  \\tClearly, Butler couldn't wait to get him back.\\n  \\t''With his ability to shoot and create shots, and when two guys run at him that opens things up for the rest of us,'' Khyle Marshall said after finishing with 19 points and five rebounds. ''The attention he gets makes it easier for our other guys.''\\n  \\tThere was no doubt Saturday.\\n  \\t\\n   \\tMarshall took advantage of his openings with a nice blend of dunks and mid-range jumpers.\\n  \\tFreshman guard Kellen Dunham, who returned to the bench Saturday after replacing Clarke in the starting lineup for the previous three games, still managed to make 5 of 6 from 3-point range and finished with 17 points.\\n  \\tForward Roosevelt Jones, who made the winning shot last week against then No. 8 Gonzaga, finished with nine points, three rebounds and three assists, and the Bulldogs wound up shooting 52 percent from the field overall.\\n  \\tThe combination was just too much for Temple.\\n  \\t''When a kid like Dunham comes off the bench and does what he did today, that's difficult to defend,'' Owls coach Fran Dunphy said. ''Then you've got Clarke on the other side, that's tough to tag and then when a kid like Marshall hits some shots from outside. ... They've got a lot of weapons, no doubt. I like their team.''\\n  \\tDunphy was just hoping for better results in Temple's first ever trip to Hinkle Fieldhouse.\\n  \\tThe Owls were led by Khalif Wyatt, who scored 16 of his 22 points in the first half and had with six assists. Scootie Randall had 13 points and four rebounds, and Anthony Lee had 12 points and seven rebounds on a day that another Philadelphia team was trying to topple another top 10 foe.\\n  \\t\\n   \\tIn addition to La Salle's court-storming win Wednesday, Villanova beat Louisville and Syracuse this week. But Temple failed in its quest Saturday, dropping to 1-3 against the top 10 this season, largely because of Clarke, who sat out last season after transferring from Arkansas.\\n  \\t''He never stops moving, he's quick and likes to get his team involved, too,'' Randall said. ''You try to stay on his hip, you try to stay with him, but he's just a good player.''\\n  \\tIt didn't take the Owls long to figure things out.\\n  \\tDespite losing starting guard T.J. DiLeo with a high ankle sprain in the first three minutes, Temple managed to control the first part of the game.\\n  \\tThe Bulldogs swung things in their favor with a 12-0 first-half run that allowed them to take a 37-34 led into the locker room that they extended by scoring the first seven points of the second half.\\n  \\tTemple charged back after trailing 51-38, using an 18-5 spurt to tie the score at 56 on Rahlir Hollis-Jefferson's three-point play.\\n  \\tBut that's when the Bulldogs cranked it up.\\n  \\tMarshall broke the tie with a dunk with an assist from Clarke and Dunham hit back-to-back 3s, both with assists from Clarke. Jones turned a nifty pass from Andrew Smith into a layup, Smith followed that flurry with two free throws and then Jones scored on another layup, courtesy of yet another pass from Clarke. When the 16-4 spurt ended, the Bulldogs led 72-60, leaving Temple in the dust.\\n  \\t''We're better in transition time when Rotnei's in the game because of the way he passes and because he's a threat to shoot when he crossed midcourt,'' Brad Stevens said. ''It was heart-warming to have him back on the court, knowing what he went through and how hard it was for him.''\",\n",
       " \"The long, arduous journey that was the fantasy football season came to an end as we waved goodbye to the 2012 calendar year. We watched a very strange, topsy-turvy campaign that included myriad injuries, confusing performance trends and the disappearances of many former stars.\\n  \\tOf course, weâve already had one huge injury in the postseason that served to shake up those early 2013 fantasy draft boards. So, we canât put the spreadsheets away altogether. (You werenât leaving football behind anyway.)\\n  \\tSoon, weâll start inundating you with fantastic statistical breakdowns on the diamond. Pitchers and catchers are just a few short weeks from reporting to Arizona and Florida. Before we do, I wanted to put a few thoughts out about the rookie class of 2012 and offer some names for late wide receiver slots on your draft board. Itâs my way of celebrating the brilliance of âAll-Name Teamâ captain and fantasy hero Cecil Shorts III.\\n  \\t\\n  \\tThe results from the Wild Round of the NFL Playoffs took a backseat to a monumental injury in Washington. On Wednesday, January 9th, Robert Griffin III underwent surgery to repair the LCL and ACL in his right knee (his second ACL repair). Evidently, there was no clear ACL damage on the early MRIs, but it required repair once Dr. James Andrews further assessed the damage during surgery. As a result, the compound damage extends the timeline for Griffin IIIâs return to the field.\\n  \\tYou can hope for the Adrian Peterson-inspired return from RGIII in 2013. I will give Mike Shanahan credit for securing a second option in the 2012 NFL Draft. Kirk Cousins slides into the starter role during Griffin IIIâs absence and becomes a mid-QB2 fantasy option. Remember, Cousins led the Redskins to a victory in Week 15 over the Browns, completing 26-of-37 attempts for 329 yards with two touchdowns and an interception (two sacks and 22 rushing yards). With a healthy Pierre Garcon, the return of Fred Davis and a strong running game onboard, Cousins should succeed in the top spot.\\n  \\tAndrew Luck led the Colts into the playoffs after passing for over 4,300 yards in the regular season. Granted, he closed out the regular season by passing for 205 passing yards or less in four consecutive games and failed to complete more than 50% of his pass attempts in his final five regular season games. He did have record six 300-yard games. Luck exceeded expectations, registering 28 total touchdowns against 23 turnovers in what was expected to be a dismal rookie season. There is a talented nucleus in the passing game, including two tight ends, though the team will need to find a complement to Vick Ballard in the backfield. Luck will enter 2013 drafts as a mid-QB1 option.\\n  \\t\\n \\tThis could be a season of destiny for the Harbaugh-led 49ers. See who's in the playoffs, and when they play.\\n \\n   \\tI remember the calls for Russell Wilson to be benched following the first quarter of the season despite recording victories over the Cowboys and Packers. Wilsonâs second half of the season made him one of the great stories of the 2012 season. The rookie from Wisconsin produced multiple touchdowns in eight of his final nine starts and he became a rushing threat.\\n  \\tWilson will eventually work the ball downfield more frequently, but this squad is built to run the ball and play suffocating defense. In 2012, Wilson attempted more than 25 passes in only five games. Heâll retain a mid-QB2 rank heading into draft season with upside.\\n  \\tRyan Tannehill finished a distant fourth in the rookie quarterback sweepstakes this season, but the Dolphins found their signal-caller for the future. Tannehill passed for nearly 3,300 yards despite injury and consistency issues in the receiving corps. Of course, Tannehill did pass for 200 yards or less in seven games that he finished (three with more than 250 yards). He threw 12 touchdown passes against 13 interceptions. With upgrades to the receiving corps via the draft or free agency, Tannehill should round into a more consistent performer. Still, heâs just a borderline back-end QB2 on the early draft board.\\n  \\tChip Kelly reportedly talked about Colt McCoy as a viable option for the Browns during his short-lived flirtation with the squad. I donât see how Brandon Weeden was dismissed so quickly after passing for nearly 3,400 yards (3,385) with 14 touchdowns against 17 interceptions (he missed the finale). Thereâs a very nice core in Cleveland with Trent Richardson, speedster Josh Gordon and Greg Little.\\n  \\tAs this was written, the Eagles were still pushing through the interview process for the head coaching job. The team will reportedly move forward without Michael Vick, thereby putting Nick Foles into the top spot. Foles passed for 1,699 yards while completing nearly 61% of his pass attempts in seven games. The Philadelphia offense is stocked with speed options and big-time playmakers. Foles will be able to thrive, provided that the team is able to build a serviceable offensive line this offseason. Heâs a second-line QB2 out of the gate.\\n  \\tSecond-Year Performers\\n  \\tWhile we lament the decision to leave RGIII on the field and his subsequent surgery, we must applaud Mike and Kyle Shanahan for leaving the running back shuffle in the past. Alfred Morris amassed 1,613 rushing yards overall with 13 touchdowns and dominated opponents down the stretch. He rushed for more than 76 yards in all but two games this season and carried the ball at least 20 times in seven consecutive games to close out 2012. I still fear Shanahan turning back to his old ways in 2013, particularly with RGIIIâs injury on the board. Still, Morris will be a mid-RB1 entering 2013 fantasy drafts.\\n  \\t\\n   \\tDoug Martin produced a fantastic season for the Buccaneers despite obvious issues on the offensive line and defensive lapses that forced Josh Freeman to take to the air. Martin earned five 100-yard games this season and helped bolster his stats by availing himself as a receiver (49 receptions for 472 yards). If you can spin Martinâs stats well to your league mates, you may find yourself a bargain on draft day. He rushed for 62 yards or fewer on six occasions, including four of his final six games.\\n  \\tTrent Richardson finished third among rookie running backs, producing 1,267 yards with 11 total touchdowns. Richardson achieved three 100-yard games and was limited to fewer than 50 rushing yards on seven occasions before missing the finale because of ankle/rib injuries. Richardson reportedly played much of the 2012 season with broken ribs. Heâll appear on the board as a high-RB2 option for 2013.\\n  \\tRonnie Hillman was expected to become âthe manâ when Willis McGahee was injured midway through the 2012 season. Instead, Knowshon Moreno emerged from nowhere to claim the top slot and produced fantastic numbers to help fuel the 11-game winning streak. Hillman produced 330 rushing yards on 85 attempts this season (3.9 yards per carry). Iâm not ready to bury him yet, but the team will certainly have some interesting decisions to make at the position. Heâs worthy of a late-round flier given the current roster composition with upside.\\n  \\tDaryl Richardson earned the second slot in the St. Louis backfield behind Steven Jackson and amassed more than 600 total yards. Heâll be challenged in 2013 by Isaiah Pead, who slid off the radar after being selected in the second round. Pead logged only 10 carries in 2012, five of which came in the season finale against Seattle. I expect Pead to slide ahead on the depth chart and become a formidable No. 2 behind Jackson.\\n  \\tDwayne Allen and Coby Fleener will grow alongside Andrew Luck in Indianapolis. Allen caught 45-of-66 targets for 521 yards, though he logged only three touchdowns. Fleener caught 26-of-48 and missed part of the season because of a shoulder injury. Allen is the more intriguing option for me in fantasyland as a potential red zone beast.\\n  \\tIâll spare the lengthy analysis of Alshon Jeffery and Kendall Wright here. Both flashed signs of becoming big-time performers in 2012. Jeffery had his rookie season upended by injury, while Wright battled a crowded receiving corps and inconsistent quarterback play. Likewise, Chris Givens amassed 42 receptions and demonstrated great downfield play-making ability for Sam Bradford. The Rams will be interesting to watch in year two for Jeff Fisher.\\n  \\tJarius Wright closed out the season well, producing eight receptions (14 targets) for 143 yards in the final two games against the Texans and Packers. He amassed 22 receptions for 310 yards overall, including a huge 65-yard touchdown reception against Green Bay. Wright will take on a much larger role in his second year whether Percy Harvin returns to Minnesota or not. Obviously, thereâs still a huge question at quarterback (are you a Ponder believer?), but thereâs speed and downfield capability here.\\n  \\tUnless thereâs a complete overhaul in New York, you wonât have to take much of a risk in selecting Stephen Hill late in your 2013 drafts. He produced 21 receptions on 47 targets as a rookie for 2512 yards, though he did missed five games.\\n  \\tLooking Deep: Next Yearâs Cecil Shorts III\\n  \\tTandon Doss will enter his third year with the Ravens in 2013, and heâs been tabbed as a potential replacement for Anquan Boldin. Doss caught 7-of-17 targets in 2012 for 123 yards. Heâs a 6-foot-2 receiver who logged 140 receptions for 1,668 yards in his final two seasons at Indiana.\\n  \\tThe Texans continue their search for a No. 2 receiving option opposite Andre Johnson. Sure, Owen Daniels has been a steady option over the middle with an occasional deep throw in the mix, but thereâs not a steady downfield option otherwise (itâs no longer Kevin Walterâs run). Keshawn Martin, a fourth-round pick out of Michigan State, caught 10 passes for 85 yards while operating as a return man for the Texans in 2012. DeVier Posey, a third-round pick out of Ohio State, caught six passes for 87 yards. Posey is the better bet for a larger role coming into 2013 barring a change in personnel via the draft or free agency.\\n  \\tLongtime readers already know of my affinity for Mohamed Sanu, who established himself as a red zone option down the stretch before an injury sidelined him ahead of the playoffs. Teammate Marvin Jones, a rookie from California, will compete for a starting slot in 2013. Jones caught 18-of-32 targets in 2012, including 10 receptions (his lone touchdown) in the final two weeks of the regular season.\\n  \\tThe Browns have an intriguing core of skill position players entering 2013. I canât believe that I just wrote that line, but itâs true. We know about T-Rich and the short-lived fantasy brilliance of Josh Gordon as a downfield threat. Iâll turn my attention to another receiving option that popped onto the radar as a rookie. Travis Benjamin, a fourth-round pick from Miami, caught 18-of-37 targets for 298 yards with two touchdowns and demonstrated some big-play potential of his own. Iâll be curious to see how heâs used once the new coaching staff gets put in place. Could he pile up short receptions with some YAC? Benjaminâs a true longshot option in this category.\\n  \\tRishard Matthews received an opportunity down the stretch in Miami because of an injury to Davone Bess. The rookie from Nevada caught eight passes in the final three games for 96 yards, including 20 and 30-yard receptions. Matthews finished the season with 11 receptions on 20 targets for 151 yards.\\n  \\tNick Toon missed the entire 2012 season after undergoing surgery on his foot. Heâll return to the Saints for 2013 barring a setback and will try to crack the rotation in the explosive New Orleans offense.\\n  \\tA.J. Jenkins was a non-factor as a rookie despite getting selected in the first round of the NFL Draft by the 49ers. Jenkins was not targeted a single time this season. Michael Crabtree finally became the No. 1 option that everyone anticipated he could be, but questions remain in the rest of the San Francisco receiving corps. Heâll have a chance to battle Mario Manningham for reps in 2013.\\n  \\tAnd because I feel the need to put his sticker on the board, donât forget about Vincent Brown of the Chargers. We were taunted and teased during the middle of the 2012 season about a possible return to action for Brown. Unfortunately, it did not materialize. With Danario Alexander working alongside Malcom Floyd on the perimeter, Brown should return as a PPR machine for the Chargers in 2013.\"]"
