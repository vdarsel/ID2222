       " \"After missing the last two weeks with a severely sprained neck, the fearless shooting guard returned Saturday and scored 24 points, knocked down three 3-pointers, made 13 of 14 free throws, dished out a career-high nine assists and led the Bulldogs to an 83-71 victory over Temple. Welcome back, kid.\\n  \\t''It felt really good. When something like that happens, it puts a lot of things in perspective,'' Clarke said. ''I felt pretty normal.''\\n  \\tFor most of the day, he looked like his old self, too.\\n  \\tClarke repeatedly sent 3-pointers over the outstretched arms of defenders, confounding and frustrating them at the same time.\\n  \\tHe drove relentlessly through the lane, crashing hard to the floor once in each half. Yes, it brought back memories of that Jan. 12 play at Dayton when he crashed head first into a padded basket support head first and then stayed down for eight minutes before being taken off on a stretcher. On Saturday, Clarke, thankfully, bounced up right away both times as he continued to play his way.\\n  \\tAnd when Temple (13-6, 2-3 Atlantic 10) dared to chase Clarke with extra defenders, Clarke had no trouble finding teammates who were willing and able to knock down open shots.\\n  \\tIt was a far cry from how the Bulldogs (16-3, 4-1) played in Wednesday's loss at La Salle, their only defeat since Nov. 21. Butler has won 14 of 15, including three wins that came with Clarke on the bench.\\n  \\tClearly, Butler couldn't wait to get him back.\\n  \\t''With his ability to shoot and create shots, and when two guys run at him that opens things up for the rest of us,'' Khyle Marshall said after finishing with 19 points and five rebounds. ''The attention he gets makes it easier for our other guys.''\\n  \\tThere was no doubt Saturday.\\n  \\t\\n   \\tMarshall took advantage of his openings with a nice blend of dunks and mid-range jumpers.\\n  \\tFreshman guard Kellen Dunham, who returned to the bench Saturday after replacing Clarke in the starting lineup for the previous three games, still managed to make 5 of 6 from 3-point range and finished with 17 points.\\n  \\tForward Roosevelt Jones, who made the winning shot last week against then No. 8 Gonzaga, finished with nine points, three rebounds and three assists, and the Bulldogs wound up shooting 52 percent from the field overall.\\n  \\tThe combination was just too much for Temple.\\n  \\t''When a kid like Dunham comes off the bench and does what he did today, that's difficult to defend,'' Owls coach Fran Dunphy said. ''Then you've got Clarke on the other side, that's tough to tag and then when a kid like Marshall hits some shots from outside. ... They've got a lot of weapons, no doubt. I like their team.''\\n  \\tDunphy was just hoping for better results in Temple's first ever trip to Hinkle Fieldhouse.\\n  \\tThe Owls were led by Khalif Wyatt, who scored 16 of his 22 points in the first half and had with six assists. Scootie Randall had 13 points and four rebounds, and Anthony Lee had 12 points and seven rebounds on a day that another Philadelphia team was trying to topple another top 10 foe.\\n  \\t\\n   \\tIn addition to La Salle's court-storming win Wednesday, Villanova beat Louisville and Syracuse this week. But Temple failed in its quest Saturday, dropping to 1-3 against the top 10 this season, largely because of Clarke, who sat out last season after transferring from Arkansas.\\n  \\t''He never stops moving, he's quick and likes to get his team involved, too,'' Randall said. ''You try to stay on his hip, you try to stay with him, but he's just a good player.''\\n  \\tIt didn't take the Owls long to figure things out.\\n  \\tDespite losing starting guard T.J. DiLeo with a high ankle sprain in the first three minutes, Temple managed to control the first part of the game.\\n  \\tThe Bulldogs swung things in their favor with a 12-0 first-half run that allowed them to take a 37-34 led into the locker room that they extended by scoring the first seven points of the second half.\\n  \\tTemple charged back after trailing 51-38, using an 18-5 spurt to tie the score at 56 on Rahlir Hollis-Jefferson's three-point play.\\n  \\tBut that's when the Bulldogs cranked it up.\\n  \\tMarshall broke the tie with a dunk with an assist from Clarke and Dunham hit back-to-back 3s, both with assists from Clarke. Jones turned a nifty pass from Andrew Smith into a layup, Smith followed that flurry with two free throws and then Jones scored on another layup, courtesy of yet another pass from Clarke. When the 16-4 spurt ended, the Bulldogs led 72-60, leaving Temple in the dust.\\n  \\t''We're better in transition time when Rotnei's in the game because of the way he passes and because he's a threat to shoot when he crossed midcourt,'' Brad Stevens said. ''It was heart-warming to have him back on the court, knowing what he went through and how hard it was for him.''\",\n",
       " \"The long, arduous journey that was the fantasy football season came to an end as we waved goodbye to the 2012 calendar year. We watched a very strange, topsy-turvy campaign that included myriad injuries, confusing performance trends and the disappearances of many former stars.\\n  \\tOf course, weâ€™ve already had one huge injury in the postseason that served to shake up those early 2013 fantasy draft boards. So, we canâ€™t put the spreadsheets away altogether. (You werenâ€™t leaving football behind anyway.)\\n  \\tSoon, weâ€™ll start inundating you with fantastic statistical breakdowns on the diamond. Pitchers and catchers are just a few short weeks from reporting to Arizona and Florida. Before we do, I wanted to put a few thoughts out about the rookie class of 2012 and offer some names for late wide receiver slots on your draft board. Itâ€™s my way of celebrating the brilliance of â€œAll-Name Teamâ€\\x9d captain and fantasy hero Cecil Shorts III.\\n  \\t\\n  \\tThe results from the Wild Round of the NFL Playoffs took a backseat to a monumental injury in Washington. On Wednesday, January 9th, Robert Griffin III underwent surgery to repair the LCL and ACL in his right knee (his second ACL repair). Evidently, there was no clear ACL damage on the early MRIs, but it required repair once Dr. James Andrews further assessed the damage during surgery. As a result, the compound damage extends the timeline for Griffin IIIâ€™s return to the field.\\n  \\tYou can hope for the Adrian Peterson-inspired return from RGIII in 2013. I will give Mike Shanahan credit for securing a second option in the 2012 NFL Draft. Kirk Cousins slides into the starter role during Griffin IIIâ€™s absence and becomes a mid-QB2 fantasy option. Remember, Cousins led the Redskins to a victory in Week 15 over the Browns, completing 26-of-37 attempts for 329 yards with two touchdowns and an interception (two sacks and 22 rushing yards). With a healthy Pierre Garcon, the return of Fred Davis and a strong running game onboard, Cousins should succeed in the top spot.\\n  \\tAndrew Luck led the Colts into the playoffs after passing for over 4,300 yards in the regular season. Granted, he closed out the regular season by passing for 205 passing yards or less in four consecutive games and failed to complete more than 50% of his pass attempts in his final five regular season games. He did have record six 300-yard games. Luck exceeded expectations, registering 28 total touchdowns against 23 turnovers in what was expected to be a dismal rookie season. There is a talented nucleus in the passing game, including two tight ends, though the team will need to find a complement to Vick Ballard in the backfield. Luck will enter 2013 drafts as a mid-QB1 option.\\n  \\t\\n \\tThis could be a season of destiny for the Harbaugh-led 49ers. See who's in the playoffs, and when they play.\\n \\n   \\tI remember the calls for Russell Wilson to be benched following the first quarter of the season despite recording victories over the Cowboys and Packers. Wilsonâ€™s second half of the season made him one of the great stories of the 2012 season. The rookie from Wisconsin produced multiple touchdowns in eight of his final nine starts and he became a rushing threat.\\n  \\tWilson will eventually work the ball downfield more frequently, but this squad is built to run the ball and play suffocating defense. In 2012, Wilson attempted more than 25 passes in only five games. Heâ€™ll retain a mid-QB2 rank heading into draft season with upside.\\n  \\tRyan Tannehill finished a distant fourth in the rookie quarterback sweepstakes this season, but the Dolphins found their signal-caller for the future. Tannehill passed for nearly 3,300 yards despite injury and consistency issues in the receiving corps. Of course, Tannehill did pass for 200 yards or less in seven games that he finished (three with more than 250 yards). He threw 12 touchdown passes against 13 interceptions. With upgrades to the receiving corps via the draft or free agency, Tannehill should round into a more consistent performer. Still, heâ€™s just a borderline back-end QB2 on the early draft board.\\n  \\tChip Kelly reportedly talked about Colt McCoy as a viable option for the Browns during his short-lived flirtation with the squad. I donâ€™t see how Brandon Weeden was dismissed so quickly after passing for nearly 3,400 yards (3,385) with 14 touchdowns against 17 interceptions (he missed the finale). Thereâ€™s a very nice core in Cleveland with Trent Richardson, speedster Josh Gordon and Greg Little.\\n  \\tAs this was written, the Eagles were still pushing through the interview process for the head coaching job. The team will reportedly move forward without Michael Vick, thereby putting Nick Foles into the top spot. Foles passed for 1,699 yards while completing nearly 61% of his pass attempts in seven games. The Philadelphia offense is stocked with speed options and big-time playmakers. Foles will be able to thrive, provided that the team is able to build a serviceable offensive line this offseason. Heâ€™s a second-line QB2 out of the gate.\\n  \\tSecond-Year Performers\\n  \\tWhile we lament the decision to leave RGIII on the field and his subsequent surgery, we must applaud Mike and Kyle Shanahan for leaving the running back shuffle in the past. Alfred Morris amassed 1,613 rushing yards overall with 13 touchdowns and dominated opponents down the stretch. He rushed for more than 76 yards in all but two games this season and carried the ball at least 20 times in seven consecutive games to close out 2012. I still fear Shanahan turning back to his old ways in 2013, particularly with RGIIIâ€™s injury on the board. Still, Morris will be a mid-RB1 entering 2013 fantasy drafts.\\n  \\t\\n   \\tDoug Martin produced a fantastic season for the Buccaneers despite obvious issues on the offensive line and defensive lapses that forced Josh Freeman to take to the air. Martin earned five 100-yard games this season and helped bolster his stats by availing himself as a receiver (49 receptions for 472 yards). If you can spin Martinâ€™s stats well to your league mates, you may find yourself a bargain on draft day. He rushed for 62 yards or fewer on six occasions, including four of his final six games.\\n  \\tTrent Richardson finished third among rookie running backs, producing 1,267 yards with 11 total touchdowns. Richardson achieved three 100-yard games and was limited to fewer than 50 rushing yards on seven occasions before missing the finale because of ankle/rib injuries. Richardson reportedly played much of the 2012 season with broken ribs. Heâ€™ll appear on the board as a high-RB2 option for 2013.\\n  \\tRonnie Hillman was expected to become â€œthe manâ€\\x9d when Willis McGahee was injured midway through the 2012 season. Instead, Knowshon Moreno emerged from nowhere to claim the top slot and produced fantastic numbers to help fuel the 11-game winning streak. Hillman produced 330 rushing yards on 85 attempts this season (3.9 yards per carry). Iâ€™m not ready to bury him yet, but the team will certainly have some interesting decisions to make at the position. Heâ€™s worthy of a late-round flier given the current roster composition with upside.\\n  \\tDaryl Richardson earned the second slot in the St. Louis backfield behind Steven Jackson and amassed more than 600 total yards. Heâ€™ll be challenged in 2013 by Isaiah Pead, who slid off the radar after being selected in the second round. Pead logged only 10 carries in 2012, five of which came in the season finale against Seattle. I expect Pead to slide ahead on the depth chart and become a formidable No. 2 behind Jackson.\\n  \\tDwayne Allen and Coby Fleener will grow alongside Andrew Luck in Indianapolis. Allen caught 45-of-66 targets for 521 yards, though he logged only three touchdowns. Fleener caught 26-of-48 and missed part of the season because of a shoulder injury. Allen is the more intriguing option for me in fantasyland as a potential red zone beast.\\n  \\tIâ€™ll spare the lengthy analysis of Alshon Jeffery and Kendall Wright here. Both flashed signs of becoming big-time performers in 2012. Jeffery had his rookie season upended by injury, while Wright battled a crowded receiving corps and inconsistent quarterback play. Likewise, Chris Givens amassed 42 receptions and demonstrated great downfield play-making ability for Sam Bradford. The Rams will be interesting to watch in year two for Jeff Fisher.\\n  \\tJarius Wright closed out the season well, producing eight receptions (14 targets) for 143 yards in the final two games against the Texans and Packers. He amassed 22 receptions for 310 yards overall, including a huge 65-yard touchdown reception against Green Bay. Wright will take on a much larger role in his second year whether Percy Harvin returns to Minnesota or not. Obviously, thereâ€™s still a huge question at quarterback (are you a Ponder believer?), but thereâ€™s speed and downfield capability here.\\n  \\tUnless thereâ€™s a complete overhaul in New York, you wonâ€™t have to take much of a risk in selecting Stephen Hill late in your 2013 drafts. He produced 21 receptions on 47 targets as a rookie for 2512 yards, though he did missed five games.\\n  \\tLooking Deep: Next Yearâ€™s Cecil Shorts III\\n  \\tTandon Doss will enter his third year with the Ravens in 2013, and heâ€™s been tabbed as a potential replacement for Anquan Boldin. Doss caught 7-of-17 targets in 2012 for 123 yards. Heâ€™s a 6-foot-2 receiver who logged 140 receptions for 1,668 yards in his final two seasons at Indiana.\\n  \\tThe Texans continue their search for a No. 2 receiving option opposite Andre Johnson. Sure, Owen Daniels has been a steady option over the middle with an occasional deep throw in the mix, but thereâ€™s not a steady downfield option otherwise (itâ€™s no longer Kevin Walterâ€™s run). Keshawn Martin, a fourth-round pick out of Michigan State, caught 10 passes for 85 yards while operating as a return man for the Texans in 2012. DeVier Posey, a third-round pick out of Ohio State, caught six passes for 87 yards. Posey is the better bet for a larger role coming into 2013 barring a change in personnel via the draft or free agency.\\n  \\tLongtime readers already know of my affinity for Mohamed Sanu, who established himself as a red zone option down the stretch before an injury sidelined him ahead of the playoffs. Teammate Marvin Jones, a rookie from California, will compete for a starting slot in 2013. Jones caught 18-of-32 targets in 2012, including 10 receptions (his lone touchdown) in the final two weeks of the regular season.\\n  \\tThe Browns have an intriguing core of skill position players entering 2013. I canâ€™t believe that I just wrote that line, but itâ€™s true. We know about T-Rich and the short-lived fantasy brilliance of Josh Gordon as a downfield threat. Iâ€™ll turn my attention to another receiving option that popped onto the radar as a rookie. Travis Benjamin, a fourth-round pick from Miami, caught 18-of-37 targets for 298 yards with two touchdowns and demonstrated some big-play potential of his own. Iâ€™ll be curious to see how heâ€™s used once the new coaching staff gets put in place. Could he pile up short receptions with some YAC? Benjaminâ€™s a true longshot option in this category.\\n  \\tRishard Matthews received an opportunity down the stretch in Miami because of an injury to Davone Bess. The rookie from Nevada caught eight passes in the final three games for 96 yards, including 20 and 30-yard receptions. Matthews finished the season with 11 receptions on 20 targets for 151 yards.\\n  \\tNick Toon missed the entire 2012 season after undergoing surgery on his foot. Heâ€™ll return to the Saints for 2013 barring a setback and will try to crack the rotation in the explosive New Orleans offense.\\n  \\tA.J. Jenkins was a non-factor as a rookie despite getting selected in the first round of the NFL Draft by the 49ers. Jenkins was not targeted a single time this season. Michael Crabtree finally became the No. 1 option that everyone anticipated he could be, but questions remain in the rest of the San Francisco receiving corps. Heâ€™ll have a chance to battle Mario Manningham for reps in 2013.\\n  \\tAnd because I feel the need to put his sticker on the board, donâ€™t forget about Vincent Brown of the Chargers. We were taunted and teased during the middle of the 2012 season about a possible return to action for Brown. Unfortunately, it did not materialize. With Danario Alexander working alongside Malcom Floyd on the perimeter, Brown should return as a PPR machine for the Chargers in 2013.\",\n",

       " \"ï»¿Benjamin Galindo entered his second stint with CD Guadalajara armed with a series of excuses to explain away a stuttering start to his tenure.\\n  \\tThe former Mexico midfielder assumed control from John van't Schip four days before Chivas hosted Toluca in its opening match of the Clausura. He had no time to build or form his own team. He opened the campaign without top scorer Rafael MÃ¡rquez Lugo. And he operated under the auspices of a chaotic front office setup incapable of setting a stable direction for the club.\\n  \\tAll of those factors â€“ plus a difficult fixture list to start the season and the usual dose of chaos for a club usually ravaged by discord â€“ ensured the results met those rather low expectations. Two points from three matches still represents a poor return for a club with Chivas' resources.\\n  \\tSunday night's 1-1 draw with Cruz Azul offered little in the way of immediate encouragement. MÃ¡rquez Lugo returned from his left knee complaint to score a wonderful goal shortly before halftime, but his acrobatic finish marked the high point in this stalemate against the nine-man side. Aside from a Marco FabiÃ¡n opportunity somehow wasted shortly after the equalizer, Chivas looked unlikely to add to that haul.\\n  \\t\\n \\t \\tLa Maquina enjoyed the better of the play and the better of the opportunities. Javier Orozco somehow conspired to miss from close range after neat work in the buildup early in the first half, but he atoned with a header a few minutes later to equalize. Mariano Pavone should have restored the lead at least once in the second half without somehow converting in front of goal. NicolÃ¡s Bertolo's harsh dismissal for a second bookable offense â€“ procured when the referee interpreted a likely penalty award as a piece of simulation â€“ underscored the notion that Cruz Azul might have collected all three points on another day.\\n  \\tThe reprieve permitted the home side to pick up a second consecutive home draw as Galindo attempts to sort out his side for the matches ahead. It isn't a brief beyond the capabilities of a seasoned squad capable of claiming a place in the Liguilla.\\n  \\tTalent isn't a particular concern at Estadio Omnilife even if other sides may possess more of it. Miguel Sabah's imminent return from a two-match ban will finally allow him to revive his partnership with Marquez Lugo. FabiÃ¡n could drop into a midfield ably marshaled by Jorge EnrÃ\\xadquez and Luis PÃ©rez. Veteran center back HÃ©ctor Reynoso provides the bedrock for a rearguard capable of improvement in front of Luis Michel.\\n  \\tWith the quality of the options available among the playing staff and the significant demands attached to managing one of the country's two largest clubs (particularly with the other giant currently sitting atop the table), Galindo won't enjoy an abundance of time to correct matters.\\n\\n \\n   \\tThe former Santos Laguna manager deserves some latitude for this opening period with MÃ¡rquez Lugo injured and Sabah suspended, but he must now steer Chivas back on track in fairly short order despite playing three of the next four matches away from home. If Galindo fails to rectify matters quickly, then he must face increasing scrutiny without the luxury of pointing to external factors as one of the sources of his misfortune.\\n  \\tAround Liga MX â€“ Jornada 3\\n  \\tClub AmÃ©rica, Club Tijuana and Tigres remained atop the table by extending their unblemished runs to three matches.

       " \"United States manager Jurgen Klinsmann provided six reasons for American fans to follow the Mexican First Division â€” now called Liga MX â€” when he named his squad for last week's stunning 1-0 victory over Mexico at Estadio Azteca.\\n  \\tKlinsmann leaned on a significant group of Mexican-based players to guide his side to that famous first victory at the Azteca: Michael Orozco Fiscal claimed much of the glory as he bundled home the winner ten minutes from time, but all five of his Liga MX colleagues â€“ DaMarcus Beasley, Edgar Castillo, Joe Corona, Herculez GÃ³mez and JosÃ© Francisco Torres â€“ featured at some stage and played their part in the historic win.\\n  \\tThe presence of those six players and several other Americans south of the border highlights the importance of Liga MX to the US efforts moving forward. It also provides more than enough inspiration to follow a league regarded as one of the best outside of Europe.\\n  \\tAlthough the Mexican top flight started its season last month, there is plenty of time to catch up on the proceedings. Right now, itâ€™s wide open: a number of clubs could secure the title at the end of the campaign. In order to ease the transition into Liga MX, FOX Soccer answers a few questions in this primer to introduce the league:\\n  \\tWhere do we stand at the moment?\\n  \\tLiga MX splits the traditional season into two tournaments: the Apertura (or â€œopeningâ€\\x9d tournament, running from July to December) and the Clausura (or â€œclosingâ€\\x9d tournament, running from January to May). The 18 involved clubs play each other once to form the 17-game league slate. The top eight finishers compete in the playoffs (Liguilla) to determine the champion in each tournament. In addition, one club is relegated to the promotion league (Liga de Ascenso MX) after every season based on a points-per-game formula encompassing the previous four tournaments. This may sound confusing â€“ and it is â€“ but weâ€™ll keep you abreast of the race at the bottom all season long.\\n  \\t  \\n    \\tThe 2012 Apertura campaign kicked off on July 20. Toluca currently enjoys a five-point lead at the top of the table after winning all five of their matches to date. Current champions, Santos Laguna, sit in the middle of the pack after a mediocre start to the season.\\n  \\tWhich teams are worth monitoring?\\n  \\tMost of the attention usually swirls around Liga MX's two biggest clubs: C.D. Guadalajara and Mexico City-based Club AmÃ©rica. AmÃ©rica plays its home matches at Estadio Azteca and has used the ample resources provided by owners Televisa to compile an expensive squad. Guadalajara â€“ better known as Chivas â€“ employs a different approach by restricting its team to players with Mexican heritage. The two teams also share a rivalry called â€œEl SÃºper ClÃ¡sico.â€\\x9d\\n  \\tWhile those two teams dominate the headlines, other sides collect trophies at a more frequent rate. Santos Laguna boasts the most consistent record of success as of late with the 2012 Clausura title in the trophy case and four other finals appearances in the past five seasons. Monterrey claims the highest international profile with two consecutive CONCACAF Champions League triumphs and an appearance in the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup on its ledger. Tigres UANL, Toluca and UNAM Pumas have all won titles in the past five tournaments to underscore the competitive nature of the league.\\n  \\tIf someone asks me about Liga MX, which names should I drop?\\n  \\tStart with a couple of key figures from the under-23 squad that recently won gold at the Olympics in London. Former Fulham and PSV defender Carlos Salcido (Tigres) featured as one of three over-age selections to the team and remains a key figure in the national team setup. Exciting prospects Marco FÃ¡bian (Chivas) and ElÃ\\xadas HernÃ¡ndez (Tigres) could soon join Salcido in the full team on a more permanent basis and perhaps seal a move to Europe in the process. Foreign clubs have also expressed interest in taking midfielder HÃ©ctor Herrera (Pachuca) and over-age striker Oribe Peralta (Santos Laguna) overseas since the Olympics concluded.\\n  \\t\\n   \\tEven if some of those players depart, Liga MX will still boast plenty of stars. Monterrey striker Humberto Suazo rates among the top finishers in the Americas based on his exploits in Mexico and with the Chilean national team. Club teammate and Mexican international Aldo Di Nigris and Ecuador international forward Christian BenÃ\\xadtez (AmÃ©rica) aren't too far behind in that particular pecking order. Mexico regulars Pablo Barrera (Cruz Azul) and EfraÃ\\xadn JuÃ¡rez (AmÃ©rica) recently returned from Europe to add to the significant delegation of domestic-based players in JosÃ© Manuel â€œChepoâ€\\x9d de la Torre's squad. Former captain and stalwart Gerardo Torrado remains as combative as ever in the center of the park for Cruz Azul.\\n  \\tHow are the Yanks doing?\\n  \\tAs Klinsmann's faith in this particular group of players suggests, they are doing pretty well indeed. GÃ³mez (Santos Laguna) heads the delegation by supplying a regular stream of goals for his successful club side. Experienced winger Beasley continues to play an integral role for Puebla despite the club's financial problems. Orozco-Fiscal merits a regular starting berth in defense for San Luis. Castillo and Corona ply their trade for Club Tijuana, the wonderfully dubbed â€œXolosâ€\\x9d (a nickname plucked from the small hairless dogs endemic to Mexico). Torres (Pachuca) completes the contingent, though the midfield schemer has started just three of five matches this season for his club side.\\n  \\tSeveral other players â€“ including former US international Jonathan Bornstein (Tigres) and Greg Garza (Club Tijuana) â€“ will hope to emerge from the reserves to claim more regular match action and nab a place on Klinsmann's radar in the near future.\\n  \\t\\n \\t \\tKyle McCarthy writes about the beautiful game for FOX Soccer, the Boston Herald and several other publications.

In fact, Anthony apparently was so worked up over his teamâ€™s sixth defeat in 11 games that he wanted to let his Atlantic Division rivals know first-hand.\\n  \\tFollowing his 6-of-26 shooting performance, one of the worst of his career, the Knicks star was reportedly involved in an exchange outside the visitors locker room at Madison Square Garden, possibly with Celtics forward Kevin Garnett, with whom he had several dust-ups during the hotly contested game â€” one resulting in double-technical fouls for the two All-Stars.\\n  \\tAfter the game, no one in either locker room would confirm the report, though the players wouldnâ€™t necessarily deny it either. Conveniently, everyone was clueless as to what had or hadnâ€™t gone on. But every indication â€” the coy smiles, the careful, overwrought language â€” said that something had gone down.\\n  \\t\\n \\tCheck out the FOXiest NBA fans and tweet us your photo.\\n \\n   \\tWhat? We may never know for sure, though a Comcast Sports New England video showed Anthony pacing and waiting for KG near the Celticsâ€™ team bus. Thatâ€™s all there is to go on for now.\\n  \\tâ€œIâ€™m going to let you all figure that out,â€\\x9d said Celtics coach Doc Rivers, who saw his team win its third straight game after losing eight of 10 between Dec. 14 and Jan. 2. â€œIâ€™m going to stay out of that. If it was the playoffs, Iâ€™d tell on him, but since itâ€™s not, Iâ€™m going to just be quiet.â€\\x9d\\n  \\tWhen pressed, Garnett (19 points, 10 rebounds) was equally coy (not that heâ€™s ever overly forthright when it comes to such matters) and brushed the maybe-disturbance off as â€œjust basketball.â€\\x9d And â€˜Melo himself â€” well, he left without addressing the media after the game, his empty locker doing the speaking for him as his silence said more than he ever would have, anyway.\\n  \\tPaul Pierce, who led the Celtics with 23 points, wasnâ€™t about to be goaded into dishing on the fracas, nor was Avery Bradley, who played the stingiest defense the Knicks have seen in some time. Bradley also scored 13 points in place of Rajon Rondo, who had been suspended by the league for contact with an official in Sundayâ€™s win over Atlanta.\\n  \\t\\n   \\tMost around the Knicks locker room were, unsurprisingly, somewhere else at the time of the quarrel â€” J.R. Smith (24 points) was getting 11 stitches above his right eye; Amarâ€™e Stoudemire (13 points) was getting treatment on his knee; and Marcus Camby and Steve Novak didnâ€™t recall where they were, but they definitely werenâ€™t in the hallway trying to hold â€˜Melo back.\\n  \\tWink, wink.\\n  \\tâ€œâ€˜Meloâ€™s a very fiery guy, believe it or not,â€\\x9d Smith said. â€œHe doesnâ€™t like to lose, and he doesnâ€™t like when people try to come up in his face. It is what it is.â€\\x9d\\n  \\tAdded Novak: â€œWeâ€™re at home and we expect to win, he (Anthony) expects to win. And I think itâ€™s healthy, I think itâ€™s good. I think that he puts a lot of importance on all these games. He doesnâ€™t take it lightly, and I think thatâ€™s what you want to see out of your leader.â€\\x9d\\n  \\tThough the details of the dust-up are scarce, and may remain that way, itâ€™s clear Anthony let Garnett and the Celtics get the best of him Monday. But at least Anthony can take comfort in the knowledge that, over the last week, Boston has burned just about everyone during a mini-revival following the teamâ€™s challenging run through December.\\n  \\tOn Friday and Saturday, Boston (17-17) logged convincing wins over Atlanta and Indiana, the third- and fourth-seeded teams in the Eastern Conference, respectively, before heading to New York for Mondayâ€™s win over the second-seeded Knicks. Mondayâ€™s win came just in time for the Celticsâ€™ return to TD Garden for a five-game homestand.\\n  \\tâ€œThe last three games have been terrific,â€\\x9d Rivers said. â€œWhen youâ€™ve got Indiana and Atlanta back-to-back and then you play the Knicks after that, and to win all three of those games, thatâ€™s great for our team. Winning this game here, without Rondo, just tells you our guys hung in there.â€\\x9d\\n  \\tThough Boston played solid offensively against the Knicks, who have made their name on defense this season, it was their defense that owned the night. The Celtics held New York to 40.8 percent shooting from the floor and have limited opponents to 37.5 percent shooting during their three-game win streak as theyâ€™ve looked a lot like the title-contending Celtics of old.\\n  \\tâ€œWeâ€™re defending a whole lot better,â€\\x9d Pierce said. â€œWeâ€™re putting more pressure on teams, weâ€™re rebounding the ball a lot better, weâ€™re moving the ball, and this is the type of the ball we envisioned when we came together. Hopefully we can keep it going.â€\\x9d\\n  \\t\\n   \\tThe Celticsâ€™ recent success has propelled them to the No. 7 seed in the watered-down East as of Monday night, and has also helped deflect some attention away from their worrisome start so far. Looking old and slow and completely out of sync for most of the season before January, Boston was finding itself with few answers for its growing list of problems.\\n  \\tBetween their poor play, Rondoâ€™s poor attitude and the recent, familiar trade rumors surrounding the team â€” the latest involving the Kingsâ€™ Demarcus Cousins â€” the Celticsâ€™ situation had grown tenuous over the last few weeks. Perhaps their only saving grace has been a train wreck of a Lakers team that has stolen most of the negative press that would have normally descended upon Boston.\\n  \\tThe heat wonâ€™t be totally off the Celtics unless they can continue to play like the team that weâ€™ve come to expect over the years, but this weekâ€™s brief reprieve may be helpful on many levels going forward.\\n  \\tâ€œItâ€™s what we can be but itâ€™s not what weâ€™ve been, and thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been saying,â€\\x9d Rivers said when asked if Mondayâ€™s performance met his expectations for his club. â€œWe can be better, but itâ€™s a start.â€\\x9d\\n  \\tAnthony, meanwhile, didnâ€™t get to finish what he apparently intended to start on Monday, but heâ€™ll certainly get his chance on Jan. 24, when the teams meet again at Madison Square Garden.\\n  \\t\\n   \\tâ€œIn the heat of the battle, man, guys go back and forth,â€\\x9d Garnett said. â€œ(Anthony is) trying to get his team to go, Iâ€™m trying to get my team to go. Both teams are colliding, not to mention itâ€™s the Knicks and the Celtics.â€\\x9d\\n  \\tAdded Rivers: â€œThereâ€™s nothing wrong with getting heated, it happens. Itâ€™s just a fun game, itâ€™s competitive, itâ€™s rough at times, and thatâ€™s good. I think all thatâ€™s good. It shouldnâ€™t ever carry over past that â€” Iâ€™ve had my moments as a player, as well â€” and it does, but you donâ€™t want it to.â€\\x9d\\n  \\tYou can follow Sam Gardner on Twitter or email him at samgardnerfox@gmail.com.',\n",

The Lakers have strung together two solid games at home since a clear-the-air team meeting in Memphis last week.\\n  \\t''We've found something that works, that's for sure, and something we can feel good about,'' said Gasol, who played 36 minutes. ''I think the way we are playing, we can be very successful.''\\n  \\tKevin Durant scored 35 points and Russell Westbrook had 17 points, 13 assists and nine rebounds for the road-weary Thunder, who finished their longest trip of the season at 3-3. Durant could sense the Lakers' desperation in their fourth-quarter effort.\\n  \\t''The whole arena felt that way,'' the three-time NBA scoring champion said. ''They needed a win. It was a must-win for them, and they came out and performed well. They were hitting shots, and they were doing a good job of protecting the paint. We missed some good shots as well. As a group, we all have to do our roles better. Every individual has to play their role to a T for us to win games, but we'll be fine.''\\n  \\tBryant and Westbrook briefly tangled in the third quarter in an exchange that earned a technical foul for Kobe. Both All-Star guards entered the fourth quarter needing just one rebound for a triple-double, but neither got it.\\n  \\tWestbrook missed his first eight shots and 12 of his first 13 before finding a rhythm, but the Lakers didn't wilt down the stretch.\\n  \\t\\n   \\t''The thought the execution at the end of the game by our team definitely could have been better,'' Oklahoma City coach Scott Brooks said. ''It's something that we're pretty good at, but a lot of that had to do with their team. They're a physical team, and they were moving us around a little bit towards the end.''\\n  \\tLos Angeles took the lead with 6:15 to play on a jumper by Metta World Peace, who had 15 points and 10 rebounds. The Lakers nursed a small advantage in the final minutes, going up 101-95 on Gasol's driving layup with 1:09 to play.\\n  \\tBryant then hit a tough 19-foot jumper with 37 seconds left, and Westbrook couldn't answer. Durant didn't have a field goal in the final 6:39, scoring just seven points in the fourth quarter of Oklahoma City's third loss in 11 games.\\n  \\tOklahoma City routed the Lakers earlier this month, with Durant scoring 42 points and Westbrook adding 27 while Los Angeles played without Howard and Gasol.\\n  \\tHoward had just eight points and 10 rebounds this time out while fighting foul trouble and missing eight of his 10 free throws. Bryant and Nash led a passionate effort by the Lakers, whose season-long missteps and embarrassments have left them well out of the playoff picture heading into the second half of the season.\\n  \\t''I'm very excited to see our progress,'' Howard said. ''We're going to continue to work, continue to talk to each other. The biggest difference is we're holding each other accountable for everything. We had a great talk in Memphis, and it's carried over.''\\n  \\tNOTES: The clubs conclude their season series in Oklahoma City on March 5. ... Lakers owner Jerry Buss celebrated his 79th birthday.

       " \"LOS ANGELES — Inevitably, if you are fortunate enough to have a father you revere live long enough, there comes a time where you have to begin searching for reminders of the man you once knew.\\n\\nThey gradually become obscured by uncertainty, frailty and other diminishing curses of age, which no amount of determination can seem to beat back. \\n\\nNow, imagine that you are not only this man’s son, but his boss, too.\\n\\nThat is the circumstance USC coach Lane Kiffin is in right now, where the wrath for the preseason No. 1 Trojans’ collapse has found an inviting, and perhaps accurate, target: his 72-year-old defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin.\\n\\nAfter Oregon ran roughshod over the Trojans on national television Saturday for 62 points and 730 yards, school records for futility that came on the heels of a late defensive collapse in a defeat at Arizona, the younger Kiffin is being besieged by calls to fire his father.\\n\\nIt’s one thing for people to suggest you take away the keys to your dad’s car. It’s another to demand that you take away the ones to his office.\\n\\nThe younger Kiffin says he will evaluate his father just as he does any other coach, an assertion that no matter how real will always be met with skepticism.\\n\\nAsked if he was pleased with his dad’s work this season, Kiffin said: “Of course not. You can’t give up historic numbers, record-breaking numbers and be satisfied.”\\n\\n“But,” he added, “as the head coach, it falls on me too. I’m not going to sit here and say, 'Well, I’m in charge of the offense and we’re scoring [51 points].' We’ll wait to see the whole thing. We’ve played 5 1/2 terrible quarters of defense. We’d played good defense most of the year. As frustrating as the end of the game was, and the game before, let’s see what happens this Saturday [against Arizona State].”\\n\\nThis is not what was expected four years ago, when Lane Kiffin, fresh off being fired by Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis, landed the University of Tennessee job. One of the reasons he was hired was the promise that he could bring his father, one of the NFL’s most respected assistant coaches, with him — a move endorsed by Peyton Manning.\\n\\nFather-son working relationships are hardly uncommon in football — Phillips (Bum, Wade), Ryan (Buddy, Rex, Rob), Shanahan (Mike, Kyle), Bowden (Bobby, Terry, Jeff) Paterno (Joe, Jay) and Schottenheimer (Marty, Brian) are among the fathers and sons who have worked together. But almost exclusively it is the father employing the son, able to shelter him while he gains experience — even if it means having to answer the uncomfortable, but reasonable, questions of nepotism.\\n\\nThat dynamic has been flipped with the Kiffins. \\n\\nIt seemed as if there would be a benefit in Kiffin working for his father, that he would have a mentor and someone who would be quick to recognize his mistakes.\\n\\nMonte Kiffin is, in many respects, everything that his son is not. If Lane can be brash, immature and sometimes incapable of getting out of his own way (the tiff with Urban Meyer to banning a reporter from practice for reporting a player’s surgery), Monte goes about life with his head down, oblivious to the outside world — a quality that in a previous generation of football circles was admired.\\n\\n“He’s all football and he’s been all football forever,” Lane Kiffin said Wednesday. “He might not be able to tell you there was a presidential election yesterday. Really, he might not.”\\n\\nNear the end of practice Wednesday, Monte Kiffin, wearing shorts, layered in T-shirts and with a baseball cap pulled down on leathered brow, meandered around the field. While other coaches sprinted or jogged with their players, Monte walked with a tilted gait, his shoulders rocking from side to side, breaking into a trot only to leave the field for a few minutes in the direction of the bathrooms. \\n\\nBut is the sort of symbolism that paints Kiffin as worn and over the hill fair? \\n\\nAs haggard as Monte Kiffin looked Saturday night, it was his schemes and players who throttled Oregon for three quarters in Eugene last season, a loss that knocked the Ducks out of the national championship chase and prompted Oregon coach Chip Kelly to seek out the elder Kiffin in the USC locker room afterward to congratulate him.\\n\\nOn Saturday, the Ducks adjusted. They ran three plays the Trojans had not seen on film and their line was the best USC coaches could remember. Lane Kiffin said the defensive coaches did not adjust well.\\n\\nAsked if his father has slipped, Lane Kiffin said: “No. That’s part of what happens. They’re not asking about Bill Snyder’s age,” — the unbeaten Kansas State coach is 73 — “because they’re not turning the ball over and they’re playing really good. They ask about your age when you lose.”\\n\\nKiffin says that, as a son, the blame being directed at his father does not bother him. He suggests that his dad probably feels worse, since it is a father’s instinct — no matter at what stage in life — to want to protect his child, something Monte has done this week by eagerly owning the blame for the defense. \\n\\nFor his part, Monte Kiffin said he ignores all the noise, which for USC at the moment is not unlike every week for every losing team in the NFL. But even for someone who has spent four decades in the NFL, who has been fired and hired many times, this has to feel like something different.\\n\\nAfter Arizona State on Saturday, there are still games against UCLA and Notre Dame, and perhaps another date with Oregon, opportunities for resurgence, or further embarrassment.\\n\\nIt’s one thing to be asked to turn in your keys, it’s another to be asked by your son. And that’s something that one way or another, it’s hard to imagine the father will let happen.\",\n",
       " 'MILWAUKEE — In a matter of moments, Saturday\\'s basketball game between Providence and Marquette went from a Big East battle to a battle with a little beast.\\n\\nWith 11:23 left in the second half, a bat made its first appearance of many that wreaked havoc at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. Repeatedly, officials stopped play while waiting for the bat to leave the court area. The second time it appeared, Providence forward Sidiki Johnson was nearly hit in the face and fell to the floor while trying to defend himself from the flying menace.\\n\\n\"I think everyone was scared the bat was going to bite them,\" Marquette point guard Junior Cadougan said. \"At one point we got so mad that everybody was throwing towels at the bat. We were all scared, even the refs were scared.\"\\n\\nIn all, the game was delayed four times as the bat dive-bombed the court, fearlessly flying close to players, referees and fans. During one stoppage, the majority of players and coaches were on the court along with arena officials trying to throw towels and warm-up shirts at the bat. Providence coach Ed Cooley took that time to run around the court with his clipboard, trying to swat the bat out of the air. \\n\\nAt the under-eight-minute media timeout, Bradley Center officials decided to turn off all of the arena lights — including the main scoreboard and ribbon board — to coerce the bat to flee the court area. The Bradley Center DJ got creative and played Whitney Houston\\'s \"I Will Always Love You\" as the arena looked like it was hosting a concert when fans took out their cellphones and swayed them like lighters.\\n\\nAfter the lights were turned down, the bat — which already has a Twitter account — disappeared from the playing area.\\n\\nThough the bat may have been funny to some, Marquette felt the constant stoppages killed its momentum. Up 58-42 following two Davante Gardner free throws, the Golden Eagles allowed Providence to go on a 6-0 run right after the bat\\'s first appearance, and eventually the Friars cut the lead to 61-55 with 7:36 to play.\\n\\nFour minutes of clock time took nearly a half hour to complete.\\n\\n\"That was a once-in-a-lifetime experience,\" Marquette guard Trent Lockett said. \"It was almost frustrating because we felt like we had momentum, and every time we had a play going our way that dang bat came back. It\\'s definitely an experience and I have a story to tell now.\"\\n\\nLockett credited Marquette coach Buzz Williams for ignoring the bat during the stoppages and focusing on the game. Williams wasn\\'t so sure he did his best coaching, however.\\n\\n\"I probably didn\\'t handle it right,\" Williams said. \"I\\'ve coached in a lot of bad gyms, but I\\'ve never seen a bat in a gym. It was kind of funny to begin with, but then it was like: Damn the bat, we have to win. There\\'s going to be a winner and a loser in the record book, and they aren\\'t going to put an asterisk (saying) there was a bat.\"\\n\\n\"I thought our kids handled it like kids initially. I thought we got back a little bit in a groove, but I don\\'t think we ever got back to where we were at.\"\\n\\nThe Golden Eagles eventually took control of the game and regained a 16-point lead with 2:21 to play. They ended up winning, 81-71.\\n\\nClearly frustrated with his team\\'s performance, Providence coach Ed Cooley sat at the podium and quickly answered \"no\" when asked if there were any bright spots in the loss. The more he thought about the question, he eventually found one.\\n\\n\"There wasn\\'t one bright spot in the game other than Batman and Robin flying around the damn building,\" Cooley said. \"That actually was pretty funny. That was really comical. I think the officials were more afraid than anybody. It was a momentum breaker. I think Batman took their crowd out of the game a little bit. I think that helped us there.\"',\n",
       " 'MADISON, Wis.  – Wisconsin coach Bo Ryan didn\\'t need to be reminded that point guard Traevon Jackson hadn\\'t exactly been dazzling anyone with his shooting this season. He also didn\\'t need to be told that the sophomore would work overtime at honing his craft so he could succeed the next time an opportunity arose.\\n \\n\"You have to work at what you do,\" Ryan said. \"When you are presented with the moment, there can\\'t be any doubts. You have to be the one that says, ‘OK, we can do this.\\' \"\\n \\nAs the shot clock hit four seconds and the game clock six seconds with the game tied at 43 on Saturday, Jackson didn\\'t have any doubts he was going to get off his shot. As the ball rattled between the side and front of the rim and the backboard, he didn\\'t have any worries that it wasn\\'t going in. \\n\\nAnd when he was mobbed by his teammates at half court following the final buzzer, Jackson had no problem saying how big Wisconsin\\'s 45-44 victory over No. 12 Minnesota was for the Badgers\\' psyche.\\n \\n\"This was a must-win game,\" said Jackson, who scored UW\\'s final two baskets. \"You got to take care of home court when you get a chance to.\"\\n \\nIt was the slowest game of the Big Ten season, with only 51 total possessions, but it was the biggest for Wisconsin (14-6, 5-2 Big Ten) in terms of regaining a foothold in a tight conference race. It was even bigger for Jackson and his maturation process.\\n \\nJackson was on top of the world 11 days ago as he and his teammates flew home from Bloomington, Ind. A few days after scoring a career-high 14 points against Illinois, Jackson displayed even more poise and confidence during Wisconsin\\'s 64-59 victory over then-No. 2 Indiana.\\n \\nBut in the next two games — two losses that sent Wisconsin from first place to a tie for fourth in the conference — Jackson made three of 19 shots, committed six fouls and beat himself up for not playing with the same confidence.\\n \\nBefore Saturday, of the eight players who had started for Wisconsin this season, Jackson had the worst shooting percentage (.333) and second-worst 3-point percentage (.231). Despite ranking fifth on the team in minutes per game (23.8), Jackson had the second-most fouls on the team, including four against Michigan State that gave him a look of bewilderment each time an official blew his whistle.\\n \\nThat wasn\\'t the case against Minnesota, as Jackson scored six of his nine points in the final 7:02, committed only one foul and admitted he was hunting for his shot during a game in which neither team led by more than two points in the final 10 minutes.\\n \\n\"I felt that I needed to step up and hit the shots,\" Jackson said. \"I don\\'t have any fear.\"\\n \\nWisconsin\\'s final two possessions were the definition of fearlessness. With a little more than a minute remaining, Jackson crossed over in front of Trevor Mbakwe and hit a pull-up at the free throw line. \\n\\nThe crossover worked so well on Mbakwe that he did it again one possession later, using a shot fake to get Mbakwe out of position and releasing the shot with less than a second left on the shot clock and 2.1 seconds left in the game.\\n \\n\"A lack of discipline,\" Minnesota coach Tubby Smith said of Jackson\\'s final shot. \"He shot fakes [and] we jump out of the way, a mistake. That\\'s how you get beat when you make the mistakes we\\'ve been making. That\\'s a recipe for getting another loss, not being disciplined defensively.\"\\n \\nIt was just another late-game problem in a series of them for Minnesota (15-5, 3-4), which has lost four straight to overshadow its first 3-0 conference start since the 1974-75 season.\\n \\nAfter Mbakwe\\'s jumper with 3:53 remaining gave the Gophers a 43-41 lead, Minnesota didn\\'t hit another field goal in its final five possessions, which included a shot clock violation and an offensive foul by Andre Hollins — who had a game-high 20 points — in the paint with 39 seconds left.\\n \\n\"I should\\'ve just gotten a shot up; that would\\'ve been the best,\" said Hollins, who didn\\'t score in the final 6:28. \"In that situation, you\\'ve just got to get the ball to the rim. It sucks to not have a shot attempt at all and they come down to score. It was a big momentum changer in the game. My decision-making on that play was very poor. Those are the little things that cost us the game.\"\\n \\nMinnesota had a chance to send the game to overtime after Mbakwe drew a foul with 1.7 seconds left but was unable to shoot after injuring his right wrist on the play. In his place, the Gophers sent Rodney Williams — a career 57.9 free throw shooter — to the line.

       " 'There is always risk involved when youâ€™re a team maybe good enough to win the NBA title and you make a deal at the trade deadline in February, just a few short months before the playoffs begin. The Rasheed Wallace trade the Pistons made in 2004 probably wasnâ€™t a very risky move â€“ but it took an incredible amount of work and persuading on Joe Dumarsâ€™ behalf to get it done.  But the 1989 trade that sent Adrian Dantley to Dallas for Mark Aguirre â€“ that was a risky move. \\n  If the Pistons would have hung on in the face of that late call in Game 7 of the 1988 NBA Finals and Isiahâ€™s ankle and all of that to beat the Lakers, Adrian Dantley would have been the MVP of the Finals. Weâ€™re talking about an NBA Hall of Famer, and yet Mark Aguirre was a great scorer and one of the gameâ€™s elite small forwards, just as Adrian was. \\n  I really believe that trade was as much about Dennis Rodman as it was about Adrian Dantley and Mark Aguirre. \\n  Adrian Dantley had the ultimate crunch-time mental toughness on his side. He wanted to be in the game at the end and felt like if he was fouled, he could go to the free-throw line and win it. Thatâ€™s what he worked all his life to do. \\n  And Chuck Daly, when he realized what he had in Dennis Rodman â€“ who I think is a future Hall of Famer and, in fact, is on the ballot this year â€“ wanted him to be a finisher because of his great defense. So he had a problem on his hands. No question, AD didnâ€™t want to come out of games and you canâ€™t blame him. He was a winner and a guy who could win the game for you down the stretch. Then you had Dennis Rodman, who could defend all five positions. \\n  If your main goal was to shut down the other guyâ€™s small forward â€“ and that was an era where there great small forwards, especially players like Larry Bird and Dominique Wilkins and Larry Nance and Scottie Pippen in the East, and of course in the West the Pistons had to have somebody who could guard James Worthy if they were going to win it all â€“ and make somebody else beat you, you put Dennis Rodman in the game. \\n  It seemed like a situation where Mark Aguirre might be better suited to that role of sitting out down the stretch. I think that was why the trade was made as much as anything else. If you look at Jack McCloskeyâ€™s record, he wasnâ€™t afraid to trade small forwards. He traded Greg Kelser for Vinnie Johnson, then traded Kelly Tripucka for AD and AD for Mark Aguirre. And I think you could have probably won the championship with any one of them. \\n  Gregory eventually injured his knee, but at the beginning he had tremendous ability and potential. We all know Kelly Tripucka was a guy who once averaged 25 a game in this league. And AD â€“ what can you say about AD, except that he was a proâ€™s pro and a great, great scorer. And Mark Aguirre did win a championship in combination with Dennis Rodman. So it all worked out for the Pistons, though Iâ€™m sure there is certainly disappointment and always will be for Kelly Tripucka and Adrian Dantley. \\n  Then thereâ€™s the Rasheed deal. Rasheed had his naysayers â€“ among people who really didnâ€™t know anything about him except that the media perhaps didnâ€™t like him. But I had a connection in Portland with Harry Hutt, who had been an executive with the Pistons, and I had heard nothing but good things about Rasheed from his teammates and Harry. \\n  When I heard that Joe D had pulled off that trade for Rasheed, I felt like if you get a player with that kind of ability who is a great teammate, you might have just punched your ticket to a championship. Yes, the Pistons won a title without a superstar, but they had guys with superstar ability and Rasheed was certainly right there at the top of that list. \\n  Good for Joe for making that deal. When youâ€™ve won a title or two yourself, as Joe did, I think you have a feel for what it might take to finish off a world championship team. Certainly, Rasheed was a perfect piece to fit in that puzzle. I think he was the kind of guy Detroit fans grew to love. He was really one of us and that made it an even better idea. \\n  I donâ€™t think the numbers tell the story when it comes to Rasheed Wallace â€“ they never have. He had some great years statistically in Portland, but his numbers could have been better. Some say, then why werenâ€™t they? What I say is what really mattered to Rasheed â€“ back to his days at Simon Gratz High in Philly â€“ was winning basketball games. \\n  Thatâ€™s what mattered to him at North Carolina and certainly what mattered to him as a pro. I thought he could have been, in the twilight of his career, the guy who put the Boston Celtics over the top. And I believe if Kendrick Perkins hadnâ€™t gone down in Game 6, the Celtics would have won and Rasheed would have two championships. Thatâ€™s what really mattered to Rasheed. \\n  His teammates felt better when he was on the floor. They felt better even when he was just sitting on the bench. Just to have Rasheed Wallace there made a difference. Thereâ€™s a certain swagger, a certain basketball IQ, a certain winning spirit that comes with Rasheed being on your team. Anybody who won a title with the Pistons in 2004 would tell you the exact same thing. \\n  Thereâ€™s a school of thought that says if it ainâ€™t broke, donâ€™t fix it. The Pistons werenâ€™t broken teams in either 1989 or 2004 but they had general managers who went for it to try to make their teams just a little bit better. If you feel youâ€™re within reach of a championship, go ahead and do it. It worked out beautifully for the Pistons with Rasheed Wallace in 2004. It worked in 1989, too, and I understand the thinking behind it, but I also feel the Pistons could have won it all with Adrian Dantley â€“ but they did win it all with Mark Aguirre and thatâ€™s the bottom line.',\n",

       " 'With 29 regular-season games remaining and the playoffs still in sight, Kobe Bryant is more determined than ever to prove he and the Lakers can become the force they thought they were.\\n\\nWhether center Dwight Howard is a part of that attempted revival doesn\\'t matter to Bryant, sources familiar with Bryant\\'s thinking told FOX Sports Ohio.\\n\\nLakers general manager Mitch Kupchak has strongly nixed the notion that Howard could be moved prior to Thursday\\'s trading deadline. But if Kupchak changes his mind, he\\'d have Bryant\\'s full support, according to sources.\\n\\nWhile Bryant and Howard aren\\'t close, no rift exists between them, either. Still, Bryant appears uncertain if Howard is the right fit on a team that must put together a fervent finish just to qualify for the postseason -- and one that is unlikely to possess home-court advantage in any round if it does get there.\\n\\nThe Lakers exited the All-Star break at an underachieving 25-29 and 3½ games out of the final playoff spot.\\n\\nOptimists will point to the fact they\\'ve won eight of their previous 12 games. But they lost 125-101 to the Clippers on the final night before All-Star weekend -- in a game that resembled little more than 48 minutes of garbage time.\\n\\nThe acquisitions of Howard and point guard Steve Nash prior to the season immediately made the Lakers the popular favorite to win the Western Conference. They were considered a sure title contender, boasting a lineup that could greatly assist the 34-year-old Bryant in his quest to obtain a sixth championship ring.\\n\\nInstead, the Lakers started slowly, fired coach Mike Brown after five games, replaced Brown with Mike D\\'Antoni, and have continued to look out of sorts.\\n\\nHoward alone can hardly be blamed, and Bryant even admires how Howard has played through back and shoulder pain. But sources say Bryant also wonders if Howard has the right approach, mental toughness and overall willingness to help the Lakers flourish in what has become their most important stretch.\\n\\nBryant is not alone in his concern, sources say. Nash, Pau Gasol and several others also seem fairly uneasy about Howard\\'s commitment to the cause.\\n\\nAccording to sources, a number of Lakers have their doubts about whether Howard takes the game seriously and \"wants it\" enough for the challenges the team now faces.\\n\\nHoward\\'s $19.2 million contract is second-highest on the Lakers (behind Bryant) and expires at the end of the season. It is believed he too would be OK with a trade, and likely welcome one if he were sent to a preferred destination. Brooklyn and Dallas are said to be among the teams with which Howard would agree to a contract extension this summer.\\n\\nSources insist it\\'s still possible Howard could re-sign with the Lakers, but that he hasn\\'t made up his mind and won\\'t come to such a decision until the season plays out.\\n\\nKupchak has denied a CBS Sports report the Lakers were toying with the idea of trading Howard to the Celtics in a deal for point guard Rajon Rondo, out for the season with an ACL injury.\\n\\nHowever, sources say Kupchak has indeed taken several calls centered on Howard. So far, according to sources, Kupchak has quickly shot down any pitches.\\n',\n",
       " 'Just when it appeared the Los Angeles Lakers had escapedÂ\\xa0their season-longÂ\\xa0drama â€” even if just for a few daysÂ\\xa0â€” a report surfaced Tuesday that Dwight Howard mocked Kobe Bryant behind his back in the locker room during All-Star Weekend in Houston.\\nAccording to the New York Post, a source said Howard \"grabbed Kobeâ€™s uniform, put it on, and imitated him in front of all the other players on the West team,â€\\x9d including the Clippers\\' Chris Paul and Blake Griffin and the Thunder\\'s Kevin Durant.\\nThe report also claims that after arriving in the locker room, Bryant â€œsaid hello to everyone on the team except Howard, grabbed his stuff and moved as far away from Howard as he could,\" according to the source.\\nWhile there may be validity to the report, it isn\\'t the first time Howard has jokingly mocked Bryant. \\nIn his introductory press conference with the Lakers, Howard amused the media with a spot-on impression of Bryant during a phone call. \\nThen in November, while on a plane following a loss to the Sacramento Kings, Howard hopped on the intercom system and gave a quick team speech, playfully mocking a \"75-year-old\" Bryant. \\nIn January, after the New York Daily News reported that the two nearly came to blows following a New Year\\'s Day loss, and just after Bryant reportedly agreed with Shaquille O\\'Neal\\'s comments labeling Howard \"soft,\" Bryant and Howard both took to social media to make light of the situation. \\nEach posted a photo of the two in a staged pre-fight showdown with Mike D\\'Antoni separating them. \\n\"The mamba vs d12!! It\\'s on lol,\" said Bryant on Twitter. \\nRegardless of their relationship behind closed doors, there has been no shortage of drama between Bryant and Howard. \\nFollowing a recent ESPN report that had Bryant quoted as saying, \"we don\\'t have time for [Howard\\'s shoulder] to heal. We need some urgency,\" Howard and his father were quick to speak out. \\n\"He\\'s not a doctor,\" said Howard in a Los Angeles Times report.\\nAdded Howard\\'s father in an interview with the Atlanta-Journal Constitution: \"I understand what Kobe was trying to do, but he went about it the wrong way. He\\'s trying to win a championship. But Dwight has to tell Kobe, \\'I appreciate your opinion, but that doesn\\'t matter. We\\'re two men on this team. We need to be reasonable about this.\\'\"\\nThe drama continued going into All-Star break, when after a 125-101 loss against the Clippers, an angry Bryant said, \"we lose by 20 or 30 points, we definitely can\\'t be laughing and joking around.\" \\nBryant never specified who his comments were directed toward, but a FOX Sports Ohio report surfaced this weekend with sources saying Bryant would back GM Mitch Kupchak should he decide to trade Howard.\\n-Natalie Venegas',\n",

       " 'But after Nani came on as a late first half substitute for the injured Phil Jones, he turned the game on its head, scoring the first and setting up a second for Javier Hernandez to put United in control of the tie.\\n Jobi McAnuff pulled a goal back to make it a nervy last 10 minutes for the home side but, despite a typical late Reading charge, United held firm to keep Sir Alex Fergusonâ€™s dreams of a second historic treble alive.\\n United came out of the blocks like a steam train and could have been two up in the opening two minutes. Danny Welbeck combined with Hernandez on the edge of the box but the Mexican dallied slightly too long in getting his shot away, his blocked shot falling to Welbeck who miscued his effort to Valencia, who in turn headed over.\\n A minute later and Welbeck had a second chance after being played in on goal by Ashley Young and this time he caught his shot well, forcing Adam Federici into a fine save low to his left.\\n Despite their early chances, Reading did well to weather the early storm and began to dominate possession. The visitors forced a succession of corners and two fine clearing headers from Nemanja Vidic under pressure from Sean Morrison kept the scores level.\\n But it was United who continued to create the better chances and Federici was forced into a fantastic double save, palming Tom Cleverleyâ€™s fierce drive into the path of Welbeck before reacting brilliantly to turn his goalbound effort around the post.\\n Reading continued to press United into mistakes all over the pitch with a relentless work rate and David De Gea was forced into a save of his own from an Adam Le Fondre shot that was arrowing into the corner.\\n With under 10 minutes of a combative half remaining, Ferguson was forced into a reshuffle after a worrying knock to the ankle of Jones, who came off the worse after going for a 50-50 challenge with Adrian Mariappa. The England player later left Old Trafford on crutches and his fitness will be of concern to Ferguson with key fixtures coming up, including the Champions League last 16 second leg against Real Madrid on March 5.\\n On came Nani and he had an immediate impact, crashing a first-time shot off Federiciâ€™s far post in the final minute of normal time in the half. And in the fourth minute of time added for a blood injury to Noel Hunt after a nasty early clash of heads with Vidic, United almost had the opener with the last kick of the half, Nani again forcing the Reading keeper into a fine save.\\n United started the second half in the same vein as they had in the first, dominating possession and forcing the Reading players back on their heels. Anderson forced Federici into further heroics by palming his shot round for another corner before the increasingly influential Nani rifled a shot just wide.\\n With Reading legs visibly tiring, one sensed the goal was coming and it came as no surprise when it came from the man wearing number 17, Nani firing home with the help of a slight deflection off Morrisonâ€™s hand.\\n Straight from the kick-off and Reading were almost level, De Gea denying Le Fondre with a terrific reaction save after Huntâ€™s back header fell into the strikerâ€™s path. But Reading barely had time to reflect on the opportunity before they found themselves two down, Nani breaking free down the right before delivering a perfect cross onto the head of Hernandez, who timed his run perfectly to nod home.\\n Reading have proved this season time and time again that they are nothing if not resilient. They have scored in the final 10 minutes on no fewer than seven occasions and they were at it once again to make it a nervy ending for Unitedâ€™s players and fans. Hunt put enough pressure on Chris Smalling in the box for the ball to fall perfectly for McAnuff to slide under De Gea.\\n And Reading almost sealed yet another memorable comeback with practically their last chance of the game from their most likely source, Le Fondreâ€™s header deflecting just wide of the top corner in the final minute of injury time.\\n MAN OF THE MATCH\\n Nani â€“ Manchester United: Came off the bench to change the game in Unitedâ€™s favour.

I feel like I\\'ve turned a corner with my swing. I\\'ve got it back on track, and that\\'s ultimately what\\'s going to help me play better.\"\\nWidely panned for switching his golf brand last month from Titleist to Nike in a lucrative deal reported to be worth as much as $250 million over 10 years, McIlroy said he now tried to blinker himself from criticism as much as possible.\\n\"At the start (of his career) I guess I paid a lot more attention to it, but now I try to not read anything or not watch anything because you don\\'t want any negative thoughts creeping into your head,\" the 23-year-old added.\\n\"It\\'s part of what we do.

The person spoke Sunday to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the Titans do not discuss personnel moves until they are finalized.\\n  \\tBefore the Titans could hire Williams, he must be reinstated by the league. Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended him indefinitely for his role in the New Orleans Saints bounty program, and NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said Sunday the league has not yet addressed Williams' potential reinstatement.\\n  \\tMunchak did not immediately answer a message left by the AP on Sunday. The Titans coach has not talked with the media about his team since the day after the season ended.\\n  \\tHow quickly the league considers reinstating Williams may take at least a week with the San Francisco 49ers arriving in New Orleans on Sunday to kick off festivities leading up to the Feb. 3 Super Bowl.\\n  \\tWilliams is the only coach or player who has yet to return to the NFL in the wake of the bounty scandal.\\n  \\tGoodell just lifted the suspension for New Orleans coach Sean Payton on Tuesday, nearly two weeks earlier than expected. Saints general manager Mickey Loomis was suspended for eight games and assistant head coach Joe Vitt for six. Four current or former Saints players were also suspended after an investigation found the club had a performance pool offering cash rewards for key plays, including big hits. The player suspensions eventually were overturned.\\n  \\t\\n   \\tWilliams was the Saints defensive coordinator from 2009-11 and was hired by St. Louis in January 2012 by former Titans coach Jeff Fisher before being suspended indefinitely in March 20112. Williams' son, Blake, also was on Fisher's staff as the Rams' linebacker coach â€” but his contract was not renewed earlier this month.\\n  \\tMunchak has known Williams since 1990. Munchak was playing for the then-Houston Oilers when Williams became an assistant coach with the team. They also coached together with the Oilers; Munchak oversaw the offensive line starting in 1994 and Williams rose from defensive assistant to coaching special teams, then linebackers and finally defensive coordinator.\\n  \\tWilliams left the Titans to become head coach of the Buffalo Bills in 2001 before becoming defensive coordinator with the Washington Redskins from 2004-07. He also was defensive coordinator in Jacksonville in 2008 before being hired by the Saints in 2009.\\n  \\tWilliams also has a relationship with Munchak's current defensive coordinator, Jerry Gray. When Williams left for Buffalo, Gray went with him and served as Williams' defensive coordinator with the Bills.\\n  \\tEven though Gray currently has the job, the Titans' defense needs help and Munchak will be coaching for his job in 2013 after going 6-10 in his second season as head coach. One reason for the losing record was Tennessee's inability to stop anyone; the Titans set a franchise record allowing 471 points in 2012. The only change Munchak has made to his defensive staff was letting linebackers coach Frank Bush go and moving Chet Paralavecchio into the job from assisting with special teams.\\n  \\tIn Williams' last season with the Titans, Tennessee ranked first in the NFL in fewest yards allowed, first in passing yards allowed and third in rushing defense. The Titans also set a franchise-record for fewest points allowed with 191 with an aggressive defense.\",\n",

       " \"Payton's season-long suspension for his role in the Saints' bounty program was lifted by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell on Tuesday, nearly two weeks earlier than expected.\\n  \\tThe decision allows Payton to attend the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Ala., on Saturday, where some of the top college players available for the NFL draft will be competing.\\n  \\tPayton, along with assistant head coach Joe Vitt, general manager Mickey Loomis, and four players including Jonathan Vilma, was suspended after an investigation found the club had a performance pool offering cash rewards for key plays, including big hits. The player suspensions eventually were overturned.\\n  \\t''I clearly recognize that mistakes were made, which led to league violations,'' Payton said in a statement. ''Furthermore, I have assured the commissioner a more diligent protocol will be followed.''\\n  \\tThe suspension was scheduled to end after the Super Bowl on Feb. 3, but was moved up after Payton and Goodell met on Monday.\\n  \\t''Coach Payton acknowledged in the meeting his responsibility for the actions of his coaching staff and players and pledged to uphold the highest standards of the NFL and ensure that his staff and players do so as well,'' Goodell said in a statement. `''Sean fully complied with all the requirements imposed on him during his suspension.\\n  \\t''More important, it is clear that Sean understands and accepts his responsibilities as a head coach and the vital role that coaches play in promoting player safety and setting an example for how the game should be played at all levels.''\\n  \\tSaints owner Tom Benson welcomed back his coach.\\n  \\t''We are all thankful that Sean Payton has been reinstated,'' Benson said. ''We have a lot of work to do and we are in the middle of it right now.''\\n  \\tPayton also needs to fill a key position on his coaching staff following the departure last week of offensive line coach and running game coordinator Aaron Kromer, now the offensive coordinator in Chicago.\\n  \\t  \\n    \\tLoomis and Vitt are in Mobile evaluating players. Loomis said he was caught off guard by the news of Payton's return. But he said having Payton back sooner than expected will help the Saints.\\n  \\t''Every day makes a difference. We've certainly missed Sean in terms of the football team and all the things that go with our business and the game. But look, I miss his friendship. We all miss his friendship. We miss him as a person. I'm excited that he's going to be back here and fired up that he's back.''\\n  \\tVitt said he talked to Payton Tuesday morning and that he should join the Saints' contingent in Alabama on Wednesday.\\n  \\t''We just found out on the way to practice,'' Vitt said. ''Mr. B called Mickey and we're all excited. Sean went and spent the day in New York (Monday). He just got back in Dallas. I talked to him on the phone about 5 o'clock this morning. He's packing his bags so we'll expect he'll be here some time'' Wednesday.\\n  \\tVitt agreed with Loomis that the timing of Payton's return is good for the team.\\n  \\tPayton is ''going to hit the ground running with both feet. His jaw is going to be set. He'll have a note pad full of thoughts and ideas and he's going to have to get himself caught up with the evaluation process of our team and looking at film, which he'll do. This is perfect, getting him back now, because he's going to be here for the readings of our players. He's going to be here for the readings of these college seniors. We start handing out unrestricted free agent tape on Thursday and Friday of this week.\\n  \\t''This is where you're building the foundation of your football team, with the evaluation process of these draft eligible juniors and seniors and the free agents that are out there.''\\n  \\tThere remains one outstanding issue for the Saints stemming from the bounty probe: What will become of the Saints' second pick next spring. As part of the bounty punishment, Goodell fined the Saints $500,000 and took away second-round picks in 2012 and 2013. However, Goodell left open the possibility of restoring the 2013 second-rounder and instead docking the team a later-round pick if he is satisfied with the club's level of cooperation in the bounty matter.\\n  \\t\\n   \\tWhat the Saints do know is that the 49-year-old Payton is set to return to New Orleans for the next five seasons. Earlier this month he signed a contract extension running through the 2017 season.\\n  \\tThe coach is the last person punished in the bounty probe to return to work. Before Tuesday, Payton had not been at work since mid-April, when Goodell rejected the coach's appeal of his suspension.\\n  \\tLoomis was suspended for eight games, Vitt for six and former defensive coordinator Gregg Williams remains suspended indefinitely\\n  \\tVilma and current Saints defensive lineman Will Smith, along with former Saints Scott Fujita and Anthony Hargrove, were given suspensions of various lengths, but never served a game. Their punishments were overturned after lengthy appeals which also coincided with exhaustive litigation in federal court.\\n  \\tThe litigation included Vilma's defamation lawsuit against Goodell, which was dismissed by U.S. District Judge Ginger Berrigan last week.\\n  \\tPayton's reinstatement is one more step for the Saints to return to normalcy, but for Vitt, said it doesn't bring closure to the bounty scandal.\\n  \\t''It doesn't for me. You're going to have ask Sean that question, Mickey that question, Vilma that question. It certainly doesn't for me. I can forgive. I'm not going to forget. It is what it is.''\",\n",

Leddy, a defenseman, said it was his first overtime goal at any level.\\n  \\t''It's an unbelievable feeling, one I'll never forget,'' he said. ''I heard that stat (best start) before the game. If we stick to doing the little things, we'll be great.''\\n  \\tThe Blackhawks started 5-0 in 1971-72 - Hall of Famer Bobby Hull's final season in Chicago - and matched it on Saturday night with a 3-2 win in Columbus.\\n  \\tOn Sunday, however, they were anything but assertive for much of the second and third period. Part of that was penalty-related.\\n  \\tStill, Chicago killed all six of Detroit's power plays, improving to 22 of 23 this season.\\n  \\tDetroit's Johan Franzen finally connected at even-strength early in the third to tie the game at 1 and set up overtime. Duncan Keith scored a power-play goal in the first period for Chicago.\\n          \\n   \\t''We could have been on our heels a little bit,'' Chicago coach Joel Quenneville said. ''Detroit was pressing (being) down a goal. You know everything's coming. They were pinching.\\n  \\t''We could have been better, but at the same time, six (games) in nine (days) could have been a factor.''\\n  \\tQuenneville couldn't really fault his club, one of two undefeated NHL teams along with San Jose.\\n  \\t''I think everybody deserves credit,'' Quenneville said. ''Everybody's contributing. Everybody was where we wanted them to be. Everybody had good conditioning to start with. Special teams, Crow (Crawford) in net, the team game. I'm pleased.''\\n  \\tCrawford, who made his fifth start in six games, was sharp again. Last season, the Blackhawks' 28-year-old No. 1 goalie was criticized for allowing soft and untimely goals. That hasn't happened so far this season.\\n  \\t''Focus has been a huge part of it so far,'' Crawford said. ''I thought I was focused last year, but I wasn't quite there.\\n  \\t''This year, I've paid a little bit more attention to that, especially throughout the game. Every play around the net, I'm ready and getting low for little things around the net so I don't give up those little goals.''\\n  \\tCrawford needed to be sharp when his teammates sagged on Sunday.\\n          \\n   \\t''I thought we really carried the play in the last 30 minutes of the game,'' Red Wings coach Mike Babcock said. ''They were better than us early. They outskated us, and then we really dug in and got playing a while. We had every opportunity to win the game.''\\n  \\tInjury-depleted Detroit has gone just 2 for 26 with the man advantage so far.\\n  \\t''We've got to shoot the puck a little more and maybe things will be a little different,'' Franzen said. ''It think it's just a matter of getting the shots and getting the traffic.''\\n  \\tHoward, who has started all five of Detroit's games, made 25 saves.\\n  \\tChicago has won four straight against Detroit, dating to Feb. 21, 2012. The Blackhawks and Red Wings met for the 722th time, the most of any two NHL opponents.\\n  \\tSunday's game was only the Blackhawks' second at home, and they begin a six-game road trip Wednesday in Minnesota. The Blackhawks don't skate at home again until Feb. 12 as they play 10 of their first 12 games away from the United Center.\\n  \\tKeith scored the only goal of the first period, during a power play 2:24 in.\\n          \\n  \\tCrawford had to be sharp to preserve the lead in second. Early in the period, he made close-in saves on Todd Bertuzzi and Henrik Zetterberg. And the Blackhawks needed Crawford as they ran into penalty trouble in the second. Detroit was unable to convert any of four straight power plays beginning midway through the second, including a 43-second 5-on-3 advantage.\\n  \\t''The D were blocking the shots,'' Quenneville said. ''Key saves by Crow (Crawford). It was a group effort, with spectacular kills.\\n  \\t''We dodged a bullet. It was the key to the game.''\\n  \\tThe Blackhawks started the third sluggishly, and Franzen finally tied it at 1 with an even-strength goal at 4:30 of the period. After Zetterberg's shot was blocked, Franzen picked up the loose puck and closed in from the right circle. He got by Keith and beat Crawford with a shot between the legs.\\n  \\tCrawford made a point-blank stop on Cory Emmerton midway through the third to preserve the tie.\\n  \\tHoward then made sprawling saves on Brent Seabrook and Jonathan Toews during a Chicago power play with just under 5 minutes left in the third. Keith's shot a minute-and-a-half later hit the post.\\n  \\tCrawford stopped Franzen's prime chance 1:30 into overtime.\\n  \\tNotes: Red Wings D Jonathan Ericsson returned after missing three games with an injured hip. ...

       " \"Victoria Azarenka overcome an often hostile crowd to win back-to-back Australian Open titles, beating Li Na 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 in a dramatic final on Saturday that contained a break for fireworks, two medical timeouts and a nasty fall that caused Li to black out momentarily.\\n  \\tThe Chinese star first tumbled to the court after twisting her left ankle, and had it taped after falling in the fifth game of the second set.\\n  \\tOn the first point after a 10-minute pause in the third set while fireworks crackled overhead from nearby Australia Day celebrations, Li fell over again and slammed the back of her head into the court.\\n  \\t\\n \\tThe women's final between Victoria Azarenka and Li Na offered great tennis and plenty of drama. See the photos.\\n \\n   \\tThe 2011 French Open champion was treated immediately by a tournament doctor and had another time out before being allowed to resume the match. The second incident didn't appear to affect Li's movement, but she later said it was a serious fall.\\n  \\t''I think I was a little bit worried when I was falling down,'' she said. ''The head was touching the floor. Because two seconds I couldn't really see anything. It was totally black.\\n  \\t''So when the physio come, she was like, `Focus on my finger.' I was laughing. I was thinking, `This is tennis court, not like hospital.''\\n  \\tAzarenka, who broke down in tears and sobbed into her towel when the match ended, won four of the next six games to claim her second major title and retain the No. 1 ranking.\\n  \\t''Unfortunately, you have to go through some rough patches to achieve great things. That's what makes it so special for me,'' she said. ''I went through that, and I'm still able to kiss that beautiful trophy.''\\n  \\tThe win meant that Azarenka will maintain top spot and Serena Williams, who lost in the quarterfinals, will become the new No. 2 in the rankings.\\n  \\tOn a crisp Saturday night, Azarenka won the coin toss and elected to receive, a ploy that seemed to work when a nervous Li was broken to start the match. After a double fault on the first point, Li's forehand long gave Azarenka the early lead.\\n  \\tThe 2-hour, 40-minute match featured 16 service breaks, with Li losing her service nine times.\\n  \\t\\n   \\tWhen she first injured her ankle, Li was trailing 3-1 in the second set. When she came back, she won three of the next four games to level the set at 4-4, but Azarenka broke back and then her serve to level the match.\\n  \\tAzarenka broke in the opening game of the final set, just two games before the match was suspended for the fireworks, a planned stoppage of play that both players were notified about before the match.\\n  \\tWhile Azarenka jogged around and practiced her serving motion during the 10-minute fireworks break, Li sat on her courtside chair for most of the stoppage.\\n  \\tIt was on the first point that she again fell to the court.\\n  \\tFrom the outset, the capacity crowd at Rod Laver Arena was firmly behind Li, cheering loudly when she was introduced. Azarenka, meanwhile, had her errors applauded, and one spectator even mocked the loud hooting sound she makes when she hits a shot.\\n  \\tThe chill from the crowd was a remnant of Azarenka's semifinal win over American teenager Sloane Stephens, when Azarenka was criticized for taking a questionable 10-minute medical time out near the end of the match. She was accused of taking the time out to compose herself after she'd wasted five match points while serving for the match against Stephens, although Azarenka said she needed the time out because a rib injury was making it difficult for her to breathe.\\n  \\tIn the second set Saturday, a few fans heckled Azarenka over the incident. One man yelled, ''Take a deep breath, Vicky.''\\n  \\tBy the end of the match, she appeared to have won some of the fans back. Azarenka's friend, rapper Redfoo, yelled down to her from the player box ''You deserve it,'' and she later blew kisses to the crowd. Someone else in the crowd shouted ''Victoria, we love you.''\\n  \\t\\n   \\tAzarenka appeared to quickly forgive the crowd, saying during the trophy presentations that she wanted to thank the fans for their support.\\n  \\t''I will always keep very special memories of this court and it will be in my heart forever,'' she said, pausing several times to find the right words.

       " \"They walked into a Manhattan hotel, knowing they were running out of time to save their season.\\n  \\t\\n \\t \\tAfter 16 hours of tense talks, the NHL and its players finally achieved their elusive deal early Sunday morning, finding a way to restart a sport desperate to regain momentum and boost its prominence.\\n  \\tEnding a bitter dispute that wiped out a large part of the hockey season for the third time in less than two decades, the league and its union agreed to the framework of a 10-year labor contract that will allow a delayed schedule to start later this month.\\n  \\tOn the 113th day of a management lockout and five days before the league's deadline for a deal, the bleary-eyed sides held a 6 a.m. news conference to announce there will be a season, after all.\\n  \\tNHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and union head Donald Fehr both appeared drained, wearing sweaters and not neckties, when they stood side by side at the hotel and announced labor peace.\\n  \\t''We have reached an agreement on the framework of a new collective bargaining agreement, the details of which need to be put to paper,'' Bettman said. ''We've got to dot a lot of Is, cross a lot of Ts. There's still a lot of work to be done, but the basic framework of the deal has been agreed upon.''\\n  \\tLawyers will spend the next few days drafting a memorandum of agreement.\\n  \\tThe stoppage led to the cancellation of at least 480 games - the exact length of the curtailed schedule hasn't been determined - bringing the total of lost regular-season games to a minimum 2,178 during three lockouts under Bettman.\\n  \\t  \\n    \\tThe agreement, which replaces the deal that expired Sept. 15, must be ratified by the 30 team owners and approximately 740 players.\\n  \\t''Hopefully, within just a very few days, the fans can get back to watching people who are skating, and not the two of us,'' Fehr said.\\n  \\tFehr became executive director of the NHL Players Association in December 2010 after leading baseball players through two strikes and a lockout.\\n  \\tPlayers conceded early on in talks, which began in June, that they would accept a smaller percentage of revenue, and the negotiations were about how much lower.\\n  \\t''It was a battle,'' said Winnipeg Jets defenseman Ron Hainsey, a key member of the union's bargaining team. ''Players obviously would rather not have been here, but our focus now is to give the fans whatever it is - 48 games, 50 games - the most exciting season we can.''\\n  \\tWith much of the money from its $2 billion, 10-year contract with NBC back loaded toward the Stanley Cup playoffs in the spring - and now perhaps early summer - the league preferred to time the dispute for the start of the season in the fall. Management made its decision knowing regular-season attendance rose from 16,534 in 2003-04 to 16,954 in 2005-06 and only seven teams experienced substantial drops.\\n  \\tFlyers chairman Ed Snider told The Associated Press he was glad a partial schedule had been salvaged.\\n  \\t\\n   \\t''I'm thrilled for our fans, I'm thrilled for all of our people that work around our sport that have been hurt by this,'' he said. ''I'm thrilled for the players, for the owners. I'm just sorry it had to take this long. The great thing is, we don't have to look at it for hopefully 10 years, or at worst eight, and that's good stuff.''\\n  \\tStill, the lockout could wipe out perhaps $1 billion in revenue this season, given about 40 percent of the regular-season schedule won't be played. And while the stoppage was major news in Canada, it was an afterthought for many American sports fans.\\n  \\t''They could have gotten here a lot sooner,'' said Marc Ganis, president of Chicago-based sports business consulting firm Sportscorp Ltd. ''They didn't hear a hue and cry from the fans, especially in the United States, when hockey wasn't played. That's very distressing. That indicates there's a level of apathy that is troubling. In contrast, in the NFL when there was a threat of canceling a preseason weekend, the nation was up in arms.''\\n  \\tAt downtown Detroit's Rub BBQ Pub, manager Chris Eid said he was ''ecstatic'' when he heard the news. He said the settlement was a big topic of conversation among his afternoon customers.\\n  \\t''Everyone misses hockey,'' Eid said.\\n  \\tHockey's first labor dispute was an 11-day strike in 1992 that led to 30 games being postponed. Bettman, a former NBA executive under David Stern, became the NHL commissioner in February 1993. He presided over a 103-day lockout in 1994-95 that ended with a deal on Jan. 11, then a 301-day lockout in 2004-05 that made the NHL the first major North American professional sports league to lose an entire season. The NHL obtained a salary cap in the agreement that followed that dispute and now wanted more gains.\\n  \\t''It was concessionary bargaining right from the beginning,'' Phoenix Coyotes captain Shane Doan said. ''As the players, you kind of understand that and you accepted that. As much as you didn't want to, we understand that the nature of professional sports has kind of changed with the last couple CBAs starting with football and basketball.''\\n  \\t\\n   \\tThis deal was reached with the assistance of Scot Beckenbaugh of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, a veteran of the 2004-05 NHL talks, then Major League Soccer's negotiations in 2010 and NFL and NBA talks the following year. Beckenbaugh spent Friday walking back and forth between the league's office and the hotel where players were staying, meeting with each side to set up the final talks.\\n  \\t''Fans throughout North America will have the opportunity to return to a favorite past time and thousands of working men and women and small businesses will no longer be deprived of their livelihoods,'' said George Cohen, the FMCS director.\\n  \\tSam Flood, NBC Sports' executive producer, said his production team was ''counting the seconds until the season begins.'' NBC announcer Mike Emrick said players will have more pressure because of the shortened schedule.\\n  \\t''The effect of even a two-game losing streak will be four,'' he said\\n  \\tThe NHL's revenue of $3.3 billion last season lagged well behind the NFL ($9 billion), Major League Baseball ($7.5 billion) and the NBA ($5 billion), and the deal will lower the hockey players' percentage from 57 to 50 - owners originally had proposed 46 percent.\\n  \\t\\n   \\tThis was the third lockout among the major U.S. sports in a period of just over a year. A four-month NFL lockout ended in July 2011 with the loss of only one exhibition game, and an NBA lockout caused each team's schedule to be cut from 82 games to 66 last season.\\n  \\t-Players will receive $300 million in transition payments over three years to account for existing contracts, pushing their revenue share over 50 percent at the start of the deal.\\n  \\t-Players gained a defined benefit pension plan for the first time.\\n  \\t-The salary cap for this season will be $70.2 million before prorating to adjust for the shortened season, and the cap will drop to $64.3 million in 2013-14 - the same amount as 2011-12. There will be a salary floor of $44 million in those years.\\n  \\t-Free agents will be limited to contracts of seven years (eight for those re-signed with their former club).\\n  \\t-Salaries within a contract may not vary by more than 35 percent year to year, and the lowest year must be at least 50 percent of the highest year.\\n  \\t-There were no changes to eligibility for free agency and salary arbitration.\\n  \\t-The threshold for teams to release players in salary arbitration will increase from $1.75 million to $3 million.\\n  \\t\\n   \\t-Each team may use two buyouts to terminate contracts before the 2013-14 or 2014-15 seasons for two-thirds of the remaining guaranteed income. The buyout will be included in the players' revenue share but not the salary cap.\\n  \\t-The minimum salary will remain at $525,000 this season and will rise to $750,000 by 2021-12.\\n  \\t-Either side may terminate the deal after the 2019-20 season.\\n  \\t-Revenue sharing will increase to $200 million annually and rise with revenue.\\n  \\t-An industry growth fund of $60 million will be funded by the sides over three years and replenished as need.\\n  \\t-Participation of NHL and its players in the 2014 Sochi Olympics will be determined later in discussions also involving the International Olympic Committee and the International Ice Hockey Federation.\",\n",
       " 'Andre Drummond wonâ€™t be playing in the BBVA Rising Stars Challenge at All-Star weekend â€“ and he might not be suiting up for the Pistons until late March.    The back injury Drummond said he incurred in attempting to block a Steve Blake shot during Sundayâ€™s loss to the Los Angeles Lakers at The Palace has been diagnosed as stress fracture of the fifth lumbar vertebra. Drummond, who saw Pistons team doctors on Thursday and underwent further testing on Friday, will be out four to six weeks, according to Dr. Ben Paolucci, Pistons team physician. The regular season ends on  April 17, which would be roughly a month after Drummond could be ready to return.  \\n  The injury was discovered by way of an MRI exam Drummond underwent on Thursday.  \\n  If thereâ€™s a silver lining, itâ€™s that a stress fracture should have no residual effects, Paolucci said. In other words, unlike disc injuries that often lead to chronic back trouble, once the stress fracture is healed, itâ€™s healed.  \\n  Once Drummond is â€œasymptomatic, doesnâ€™t have any pain,â€\\x9d Paolucci, who said Drummondâ€™s injury is â€œnot uncommon,â€\\x9d said he would be able to begin on exercise programs. He estimated that process could take four weeks. Drummond has been fitted with a custom brace, he said.  \\n  Lawrence Frank met with reporters before the Pistons released the extent of Drummondâ€™s injury, though Frank already knew of his status.  \\n  â€œI know what the story is,â€\\x9d he said. â€œHe went to see a doctor today. Weâ€™re fully aware of what it is, wrapped our arms around it. Weâ€™ll just move forward.â€\\x9d  \\n  Over 50 games, Drummond has shown steady â€“ and often remarkable â€“ improvement from a player the Pistons werenâ€™t certain would be ready to crack the rotation when training camp opened. He averaged 7.3 points and 7.5 rebounds in 20 minutes a game and emerged as an impact player at both ends with his instinctive offensive rebounding skills, his elite ability to finish at the rim and his athleticism defensively giving the Pistons the rim protector theyâ€™d sought since the glory days of Ben Wallace and Rasheed Wallace.  \\n  Drummond played on Monday against New York, one day after suffering the injury, but was shut down at halftime when he informed the training staff that he was having difficulty getting his back loose. He felt better on Wednesday, but four minutes into his stint against Brooklyn, Drummond absorbed a charging foul from Brook Lopez and landed on his tailbone, exacerbating the injury, he said afterward. He didnâ€™t return to the game.  \\n  Drummond saw Pistons team doctors on both Thursday, sitting out practice, and went through more tests on Friday that determined the nature of the injury.  \\n  With Drummond sidelined, Frank will weigh his options for the frontcourt rotation. Slava Kravtsov is the player who most closely approximates Drummondâ€™s skill set as another athletic 7-footer who has a track record as a shot-blocker in Europe. But Kravtsov has played sparingly this season, just 24 minutes spread out over six games. Eleven of those minutes came in Wednesdayâ€™s loss to Brooklyn, when he scored four points and grabbed two rebounds.  \\n  â€œThatâ€™s why you carry three centers,â€\\x9d Frank said before Fridayâ€™s game with San Antonio. â€œItâ€™s a great opportunity for Slava. Heâ€™s putting a lot of work in. Heâ€™s been extremely professional.â€\\x9d  \\n  Frank could also attempt to alter the rotation so that Jason Maxiell, though undersized, plays backup minutes to Greg Monroe at center while Charlie Villanueva and Jonas Jerebko fill in at power forward. Jerebko has been playing as Kyle Singlerâ€™s backup at small forward since last weekâ€™s trade that shipped Tayshaun Prince and Austin Daye to Memphis and brought point guard Jose Calderon to Detroit from Toronto.  \\n  â€œWeâ€™ll also need more from Greg, more from Max, Charlie and Jonas,â€\\x9d Frank said. â€œThatâ€™s the NBA â€“ next man up.â€\\x9d\\n                                       True Blue Pistons',\n",

       " 'Five years ago, Steven Holcomb was the top-ranked bobsled driver in the United States. He was arguably the very best in the world.\\nHolcomb was winning just about every race his two- and four-men teams competed in, beating the Russians and the Germans, the longtime class of the sport. His gold-medal dreams were never more realistic; his skills never so sharp.\\n\\nBut he had a secret that was burrowing inside of him.\\n\\nSteven Holcomb was going blind.\\n\\nHolcomb’s story, shared in his recently released memoir “But Now I See” is one of triumph and courage. But it’s also one of deep sorrow and grief. In the wake of the tragic Jovan Belcher murder-suicide in Kansas City, Mo., on Dec. 1, stories like Holcomb’s hopefully can inspire other athletes to do what the 2010 gold-medal winner did when he reached his lowest point — speak up and seek professional help.\\n\\nWhile it may have appeared as though the world was in Steven Holcomb’s hands in 2007, his life was a “spiraling mess.”\\n\\nWhen we met recently in a midtown Manhattan restaurant, he arrived in sweats and a baseball hat with a small titanium case held firmly in his right hand.\\n\\n“What’s in there?” I asked the 32-year-old world champion.\\n\\n“My gold medal. People always seem to ask me about it, so I just bring it with me.”\\n\\n“Everywhere?”\\n\\n“Pretty much,” he nodded. “What’s the point of it collecting dust in a basement?”\\n\\nHolcomb holds tightly to his gold medal as he does everything else in his life these days. He’s both grateful and aware of how close he was to losing it all.\\n\\nAt the peak of his athletic career, Holcomb’s vision was deteriorating at an alarmingly rapid pace. On the surface, everything seemed OK. He was placing first at events and he was smiling in photographs. The US bobsled team was as good as it\\'d been in years, and he was one of the main reasons why.\\n\\nInside, however, he was losing his grip.\\n\\nFor years, Holcomb’s vision had been getting steadily worse. Scared of what could happen if the USOC or his coaches deemed his vision too poor to get in the sled, he would shake and shuffle his way through annual physicals and eye exams. Before the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, he went to great measures to hide his secret.\\n\\n\\n“I felt like I had no choice, really,\" he told me over lunch. \"I memorized the lines of the eye chart you see in doctor’s offices. I had it down. F-E-L-O-P-D. D-E-F-P-O-T-C. If nobody knew I was going blind, and my performance wasn’t taking a hit, I figured I’d be OK. But I was cheating. Not the PED type of cheating, but cheating nonetheless. Everyone else viewed the eye test as a joke, but not me. I needed to pass. So I memorized the chart and kept on going with the charade.”\\n\\nBut as time progressed, things got worse.\\n\\n“Bobsled is not a one-man sport. It’s a team game,\" Holcomb said. \"And it’s dangerous. I was the driver, and I was going blind. Every time we raced, I had a best friend or three best friends’ lives in my hands. And I couldn’t see a thing. Worse, I couldn’t say a thing. That guilt, that secret — it really weighed on me.”\\n\\nA socially active guy who grew up skiing competitively with the likes of Lindsey Vonn and Julie Mancuso, he became reclusive in his mid-20s. In the sled, everything was normal. But once he’d be outside, in the real world with teammates, he was forced to constantly find creative ways to cover up his deteriorating sight. His inability to see anything made being social difficult. His inability to say anything about it made life downright arduous.\\n\\n“There were some very dark times. Times I don’t like thinking about today,” he said, with the gold medal resting on a bench between us.\\n\\nHolcomb had become so accustomed to the courses he was racing on that he was able to guide the bobsled by feel and by sound. “If I had perfect vision, I’m not sure I would have been performing as well as I was. I could only see the very small window in front of me. There was nothing to be scared or distracted by. I zeroed in. When a race started, I had no choice but to be in the zone.”\\n\\nBut the more he\\'d win, the more the guilt and the lies would eat away at him. What if his teammates knew he was guiding their sled — and essentially, holding their lives in his hands — without functioning eyes? What if, God forbid, his other senses failed him?\\n\\n“It would have been a major tragedy,” he said softly. “A major tragedy that would have been entirely my fault.”\\n\\nHe’d been diagnosed with keratoconus, a rare eye disease that leads to the degeneration of the structure of the cornea, in 2000. But he always figured his eyesight eventually would improve. He thought it’d get better or that he’d be able to get around it. “It never did. It got worse and worse. It got to the point where I couldn’t deal with it anymore.”\\nAt 27, with his bobsled career on a trajectory set for Olympic superstardom, he attended an event with sponsors in Colorado Springs. “I’d smiled and laughed and lied with effortless abandon, leading them on to believe that the money they were investing, and the time they were putting into me was worth it,” he wrote in his memoir. “My teammates were entrusting their lives to me and I was foolishly keeping a dangerous and devastating secret. One slip, one crash, one wrong move, and I would be responsible for injuring an athlete who had no clue about the conditions under which he would be competing.”\\n\\nHolcomb left the event alone and slumped into the king-size bed in his hotel room when he got back. He was living a lie. He was depressed. He couldn’t take it anymore. That night, he very nearly took his own life.\\n\\n“The demon’s logic prevailed,” he told me, now five years removed from the night he’ll never forget. With too many lies, too much at stake and nowhere to turn, Holcomb took 73 sleeping pills that night — an entire bottle — and chased them down with a large handle of Jack Daniels whiskey.\\n\\nNo note was written. No last-second text message was sent.\\n\\n“I thought I would sleep forever,” he wrote in the book.\\n\\nThe strains of a dual life had finally become too much to withstand. That night, Steven Holcomb was willing to give it all up.\\n\\nHe never expected to wake up.\\n\\nAnd when he inexplicably did, he had an epiphany.\\n\\n“I was depressed. I needed to speak to someone. I had to let it all out. The lies. The guilt. Everything. I couldn\\'t do it anymore.”\\n\\nHolcomb, fortunate to be alive, decided that it was time to seek professional help.\\n\\nHe also woke up with the realization that it was time to tell his coach — and his teammates — about his deteriorating vision. In an emotional moment, he met with coach Brian Shimer and told him about his condition. At the end of the conversation, Holcomb retired from the sport.\\n\\n“He didn’t get mad,” Holcomb recalled. “Instead he was like, ‘Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. Let’s see what we can do first. There has to be a treatment.\\' ”\\n\\nFor nearly a decade, Holcomb’s vision had gotten steadily worse. He’d been to many doctors for checkups and had stayed up countless late nights researching on the web. Though his coach was optimistic, Holcomb was certain there was no treatment for keratoconus.\\n\\nMere days after their sit-down and Holcomb\\'s retirement, Shimer called with promising news. There was a doctor in California, Dr. Brian Boxer Wachler, who had recently started doing surgeries for the degenerative eye disease. The US Olympic Committee and the US Bobsled and Skeleton Federation ponied up the money — “I could have never afforded it,” Holcomb said — and he was sent to California for the procedure. Known in the clinical community as C3-R, it was a success. Though he’d never have 20/20 vision again, Steven’s deteriorating eyes would deteriorate no more.\\n\\n“There was hope in my life, again,” he said. “After nearly ending it all, my secret was not only off of my chest, but my eyes were finally addressed, too. All that mystery, all that guilt — it was suddenly gone.”\\n\\nWith his fears conquered and with clinical help guiding him through his ongoing bouts with mental illness, Holcomb got back in the sled.\\n\\nThree years later, he was the driver of the four-man US bobsled team that won gold in Vancouver.\\n\\nNow, at 32, he eyes another gold medal in 2014 as his next career goal.\\n\\n“It’s amazing now to think about how dark a place I was once in,” Holcomb said, eyeing the case that contains his gold medal. “I’m good now. But I had to address what was making me so dark. I had to speak to someone. Not everyone’s able to come to that realization.\"\\n\\nIn the wake of the Belcher tragedy in Kansas City, it’s a conversation we all should be having. If there’s something going on, it’s OK to seek out professional help.

       " \"Like old times. The two-time league MVP nailed a one-timer from the left circle on a power play, skated a few feet, bent his left knee and unleashed that familiar downward celebratory fist pump. He then collected the customary row of high-fives as he skated past the Capitals bench.\\n  \\tAnd, naturally, it proved to be the decisive goal in the game, coming with 14:49 remaining in a 3-2 victory over the Buffalo Sabres. The Capitals hadn't won - and Ovechkin hadn't scored - since May 9, 2012, during a playoff series against the New York Rangers.\\n  \\t''We finally win,'' Ovechkin said. ''So it's much, much better for us right now. No pressure (on) our shoulders.''\\n  \\tJoel Ward scored his third goal of the season, John Erskine got his first since the 2011 playoffs, and Michal Neuvirth made 22 saves for the Capitals, who had opened with four consecutive losses for the first time since 1993-94. The sluggish start - which included far too many needless penalties and defensive lapses - led players and new coach Adam Oates to openly question the team's work ethic.\\n  \\tNot so on Sunday. The Capitals went to the penalty box only twice and didn't allow a power play goal for the first time this season. After the final whistle, the players gathered at center ice and raised their sticks to the fans, a fitting showing of thanks from the last team in the league to get a win. It was also Oates' first as an NHL head coach.\\n  \\t''I was kind of hoping it would be sooner,'' Oates said, ''but I'm glad.''\\n          \\n   \\tOvechkin's goal gave Washington a 3-1 lead. Marcus Foligno put in a rebound with 9:47 remaining to pull the Sabres within one, but Neuvirth and the Capitals survived Buffalo's final push for a tying goal.\\n  \\tOvechkin should have had a second goal in the final minute, but he hit the post of an empty net after the Sabres had pulled Ryan Miller for an extra skater. Nevertheless, Ovechkin looks more comfortable now that he's back on the left wing. He was on the right side for the first time in his career for most of the first three games, an experiment by Oates that's been shelved for now.\\n          \\n   \\tTyler Ennis scored in the first period, and Miller made 27 saves for the Sabres, who have lost three straight after opening the season with a pair of wins. Buffalo played without left wing Thomas Vanek, who had been on the ice for all 11 goals in Buffalo's first four games. Vanek sat out with a muscle strain, sustained in the loss to the Carolina Hurricanes on Friday, and was replaced by Nathan Gerbe on the top line with Cody Hodgson and Jason Pominville.\\n  \\t''As a line they didn't get much going on,'' Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said. ''It looked like maybe a little fatigue in their game. ... A couple of our top guys didn't quite have it.''\\n  \\tNOTES: Sabres 18-year-old rookie C Mikhail Grigorenko was stopped from point-blank range early in the third period and remains without a point through five games. The Sabres will use up a year of his entry-level contract if he plays in one more game, so the team has to decide whether to send him back to the juniors. ''I'm going to look at it again,'' Ruff said. ''I thought overall it was a good showing for him. You'd like to see him finish that play.'' ... The Capitals had led for only 2:32 all season before Erskine's second-period goal. ... The Sabres entered the game as by far the worst faceoff team in the league and got even worse, winning only 20 of 53 draws (38 percent) against the Capitals. ... Washington C Marcus Johansson, who had no points and a team-worst minus-5 plus-minus rating over the first four games, was a healthy scratch for the first time this season.\",\n",

His family was forced to discontinue life support Saturday for a man who never went down without a fight.\\n  \\tReflections on his career have begun, and we\\'ll begin with this one: We have lost one of the greats.\\n  \\tWhen we look back at his career, the one thing that stands out is that he fought for a significant period of time, fought some of the best fighters of both his generation and all time â€¦ and managed to win nearly every time.\\n  \\tThe fact that he was considering a fight in 2013, at the age of 50, shows us that Camachoâ€™s boxing career was one of sustained excellence. He may have fought sporadically toward the end of his career, but even after the age of 40 Camacho went 5-2-1 against respectable competition. In an age when many fighters have long since left the sport, he still managed to rack up a number of victories for the love of the sport as opposed to fighting (and losing) because he needed the money.\\n  \\tWhen you look at his prime years as a fighter, the list of guys he fought becomes all that much more remarkable: Rafael Limon, Jose Luis Ramirez, Edwin Rosario, Ray Mancini, Julio Cesar Chavez, Felix Trinidad, Cornelius Boza-Edwards, Roberto Duran, Vinny Pazienza, Greg Haugen, Roberto Duran, Sugar Ray Leonard and Oscar De La Hoya. Usually someone with that resume is a stepping stone on the way up or an elite level fighter who took on everyone that mattered. Camacho was the latter, of course, and it\\'s proven by a single, astonishing fact.\\n  \\t\\n  \\tNone of those opponents, who in their own rights have stopped laundry lists of opponents, stopped Camacho.\\n  \\tThe man fought De La Hoya, Chavez and Trinidad (among others) when they were at their peaks in the lightweight division. Over 30 years, to face some of the hardest punchers in the sport, and some of the best fighters in the sportâ€™s history, and never to have been stopped is a remarkable accomplishment. To go that many rounds with so many guys known for knocking out people, and lasting long enough to hear the final bell as well as listen to the judgesâ€™ scorecards, is a feat of legends.\\n  \\tThe fact that he fought professionally for more than three decades while maintaining such a record, elevates Camacho into the upper echelon.\\n  \\tTo put it in perspective, it would take boxingâ€™s two best age-defying fighters, James Toney and Bernard Hopkins, another six years to match that output.\\n  \\t\\n \\tWe remember those who died in the sports world in 2012.\\n \\n   \\tAnd this doesn\\'t take into account Camacho\\'s amateur fights. Plenty of fighters have had substantial careers as professionals, but donâ€™t have 100-plus fights as an amateur to boot. Add in a number of Golden Gloves championships to match four world titles, and itâ€™s a body of work that almost feels fictional.\\n  \\tAnd sadly, this \"Rocky\"-like career has met an abrupt and tragic end. Camacho will, and should always be remembered as a world-class fighter, despite all the drama that accompanied his private life.\\n  \\tHis contribution to the sport of boxing will never be forgotten.',\n",

Maurice Jones-Drew won the NFLâ€™s rushing title in 2011 with a 1,606-yard campaign.\\n  \\tA 1989 first-round pick by the Seattle Seahawks, Heck was an NFL tackle for 12 seasons. He also played for the Chicago Bears (1994-98) and Washington Redskins (1999-2000).

Itâ€™s not a knock on LeBron or taking anything from him, because the stuff heâ€™s done is unreal as well, but itâ€™s kind of hard to compare anybody to Michael Jordan.â€\\x9d\\n    James started his NBA career wearing Jordanâ€™s No. 23, but switched to 6 later and suggested that no one in the league should wear 23 again out of tribute to Jordan. The plan never stuck.\\n    And while establishing his own identity, James still finds himself dodging Jordanâ€™s impressive shadow.\\n    â€œYou canâ€™t compare guys until both guys are finished playing,â€\\x9d Durant said. â€œYouâ€™ll see when Kobe Bryantâ€™s done playing how you can compare him to Michael, Magic Johnson and LeBron, stuff like that. But while theyâ€™re playing, I donâ€™t think you can really compare them.â€\\x9d\\n    This stretch of proficiency is just another phase in Jamesâ€™ ascent. Where heâ€™ll end up, whether heâ€™ll ever approach all those titles James, Wade and Chris Bosh predicted when they joined in Miami, is still to be determined.\\n    â€œEvery year, heâ€™s come back a better player for 10 years now. Thatâ€™s remarkable in itself. Not a lot of guys can say that. Iâ€™m not so sure heâ€™s at his peak, which is frightening,â€\\x9d said Oklahoma City coach Scott Brooks, a Jordan contemporary. â€œWhat he is able to do at the level that he does it on both ends of the floor, you usually donâ€™t see. You donâ€™t see it often.â€\\x9d\\n    Jordan, although he hadnâ€™t been in the league as long after playing at university, was 28 when he won his first championship in 1991.\\n    James had just turned 28, and Wade cautioned that he was still only starting his own, unique story.\\n    â€œMJâ€™s legacy at 50 years old is still going strong,â€\\x9d Wade said, â€œand Lebron Jamesâ€™ legacy will be the same.â€\\x9d',\n",

       " 'When you look at how this season has gone for the Pistons, you canâ€™t help but look at the timing of moving Jason Maxiell into the starting lineup at power forward and how that move really made everything fall into place for Lawrence Frankâ€™s frontcourt rotation. The power forward position with the Pistons has become one of absolute strength. It took a lot of experimentation before Lawrence decided to start Jason, bring Jonas Jerebko off the bench but give him significant minutes, and let Ben Wallace play significant minutes as the backup to Greg Monroe at center.    The results show they were dead-on in terms of what was the right thing to do for this team. The Pistons are 17-14 since Jason began starting at power forward. Theyâ€™re obviously surging despite facing a tough road trip, but they left on this trip winners of five of six and nine of the last 11 at home. This particular rotation has worked out perfectly.  \\n   Jason is absolutely at the top of his game. Consistency of minutes â€“ knowing that youâ€™re not only part of the plan, but youâ€™re being counted on to do what you do best and given an opportunity to do what you do best â€“ has been a perfect recipe for Jason.  \\n   Despite the fact heâ€™s 6-foot-7, Jasonâ€™s a classic power forward who can bang with the best. Heâ€™s a terror on the offensive boards, a very good shot blocker, and add to that the mid-range jump shot. I always kid him about his feathery jumper. Heâ€™s got a great touch. You look at a guy that size, who does that much banging, it doesnâ€™t seem to go together, but itâ€™s a great thing to have in your arsenal.  \\n   What Greg Monroe has done speaks for itself, which allows Ben Wallace to do what he does best: come in and play consistently great defense â€“ not good, not very good, but great â€“ and do it with his incredible basketball IQ.  \\n   Then throw in what Jonas Jerebko can give you off of the bench, which on more nights than not is borderline sensational. As his dad Chris told me when we talked before the game against Washington â€“ and Chris played some basketball at Syracuse and over in Sweden before settling down and deciding to make his life there â€“ Jason is a classic power forward and Jonas is probably a three/four, a small forward type of power forward.  \\n   Jonas runs the court probably as well as anybody who plays that position. He has a real arsenal of offensive weapons. Give him time to get his feet set behind the long line and heâ€™s going to knock down threes. He gets to the basket and jams or finger rolls, he can shoot the short jumper and his big, sweeping hook shot is very reliable.  \\n   He and Ben Wallace have always had a great chemistry. When those two guys are on the court together â€“ are they are a lot in their roles these days â€“ they make great plays together. The give and go against Orlando in a tight crowd around the basket, where Jonas went inside to Ben with a great pass, made a hard cut to the hole and Ben â€“ the excellent passer that he is â€“ found him with perfect timing for an easy score had the Magic shaking their heads.  \\n   I love having Jonas around. Letâ€™s give Joe Dumars some props for getting him at pick 39. You donâ€™t get players like that, at that depth of the draft, very often.  \\n   Both Jonas and Jason pick up their teammates with their style of play. Not only do they pick up their teammates, they pick up the crowd. Theyâ€™ve had a lot to do with the fact the Pistons have become very, very difficult to beat at The Palace. When Jason makes a big block or a dynamite dunk or one of his patented stick-back slams, the place goes crazy and, of course, his teammates love it.  \\n   When you have Jonas on the floor, all he does is run the court. Iâ€™d say that 20 to 25 percent of his points come from never giving up on a play. If thereâ€™s a fast break, heâ€™s always going to be following the play, whether itâ€™s defensively or offensively. Heâ€™s liable to get a late shot block or be there for a quick defensive rebound if heâ€™s trying to run somebody down on a break. Offensively, if somehow or other the shot doesnâ€™t go or a last-second pass has to be made, Jonas is there to clean it up. Thatâ€™s just what he does.  \\n   I donâ€™t think you can measure what that means to his teammates. Heâ€™s more than willing to be assertive offensively, but just like Jason, you wonâ€™t see one bit of selfishness in his game. Both those guys want to make the right play, not for themselves, but for the Detroit Pistons. Those two, sharing that power forward position, are a big, big reason why the Pistons have been playing like a playoff team for the past two months.',\n",

       " \"Before the former Chicago Bears star fired a bullet into his chest last year, he left word with his family to have his brain examined for damage he believed was caused by repeated blows to the head from his hell-bent style on the football field.\\n  \\tJunior Seau was an even bigger star in the NFL, and yet he ended his life Wednesday in much the same way as Duerson and former Atlanta Falcons safety Ray Easterling: self-inflicted gunshot wounds.\\n  \\tNow friends wonder if the San Diego icon hoped his death might leave a greater legacy than any of his amazing feats on the gridiron.\\n  \\tFormer player Kyle Turley, who is dealing with his own mental issues and has already agreed to donate his brain for research after his death, has no doubt that Seau wanted to make sure his brain could be studied for the telltale signs of football-related trauma. That's why, Turley believes, his friend shot himself in the chest instead of the head.\\n  \\t''Knowing Junior as I did, he was a very strong kid,'' Turley told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.\\n  \\t''Somewhere, the wires got crossed and he unfortunately decided to end his life. But in his last moment â€” and I will without a doubt believe this until the day I die â€” Junior Seau ended his life in a valiant way.''\\n  \\tSeau's death was ruled a suicide by the San Diego County medical examiner's office after an autopsy Thursday. Officials were awaiting a decision by the family on whether to turn over Seau's brain to unidentified outside researchers for study. A more in-depth investigative report could take up to 90 days.\\n  \\t\\n   \\tSeau, 43, was one of the NFL's most rugged players, a fierce-hitting linebacker selected for the Pro Bowl a dozen years in a row. He played for three teams over two decades, far longer than the average football career, before finally retiring for good at age 40.\\n  \\tThree years later, he decided to end his life. There were signs of trouble away from the field: a divorce, a domestic violence charge involving his girlfriend, though he was never formally charged.\\n  \\tHours before the domestic violence arrest, his car plunged over a 100-foot cliff in what some speculated was an attempt to kill himself. Seau survived with only minor injuries and insisted that he had simply fallen asleep at the wheel.\\n  \\tSeau never indicated publicly he was having trouble with life after the NFL because of all those blows to the head, and his family said he seemed happy.\\n  \\tThat's a far cry from Easterling, who died last month at age 62. He suffered from dementia and led a lawsuit filed by a number of prominent retired players, claiming the league didn't do enough to deal with concussion-related injuries.\\n  \\tNotably, Seau didn't join that lawsuit. Also, it's not known if he wanted Boston University, which has been conducting research into football-related head trauma, to study his brain for signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive degenerative disease that can be caused by multiple concussions and only detected after death.\\n  \\tThe school said in a statement it was ''saddened by the tragic death of Junior Seau,'' but declined to discuss his case without family approval.\\n  \\t\\n   \\tThomas Demetrio, an attorney for the Duerson family, said it would be ''pure speculation'' to say that Seau had the same motivation for ending his life as the former Bears safety.\\n  \\t''Dave made it easy,'' Demetrio said. ''He left notes. He sent texts to his family letting them know he wanted his brain studied. I don't know that we have a good answer for why Junior did it.''\\n  \\tBut if Seau was dealing with CTE or a similar condition, that would make it easier to comprehend what sort of jumbled thoughts the former player might've had running through his mind. Demetrio hopes that Seau's family will allow his brain to be studied by the Boston University team.\\n  \\t''We know that CTE affects your judgment. We know it affects the control of your emotions. We know that it affects your suicidal tendencies,'' the attorney said.\\n  \\tOthers also were struck by the method of death that Seau chose.\\n  \\t''Junior, as we know, put the gun to his chest,'' said Shawn Mitchell, a longtime San Diego Chargers chaplain and pastor at a church in Oceanside, Calif., the beach community where Seau lived and died.\\n  \\t''He was a very big man. If any man could take a bullet and live through it, it would be Junior Seau. He chose to do it that way.''\\n  \\t\\n   \\tSeau surely had troubles in his life. Beyond those that were readily apparent to the public, there were plenty of whispers that he played so long largely because he needed the money, that his divorce took a heavy toll on his finances.\\n  \\tTurley isn't buying it. Seau, he said, came from humble beginnings and wasn't driven by money. Even if most of his earnings went to alimony and child support, it shouldn't have been enough to drive him over the edge.\\n  \\t''You can talk about the divorce, say he was failing financially. Whatever,'' Turley said. ''A lot of people are dealing with that and they don't kill themselves. This is a person who had more reason to live than not. It just doesn't make sense.''\\n  \\tHe is convinced that another factor was in play, a hidden killer that Seau couldn't make sense of and no one else could see.\\n  \\t''There are myriad factors that create a downward spiral of depression,'' Turley said. ''But every one of these cases is exactly the same as far as the brain is concerned. There's a very visual disruption in the brain areas that control impulses, depression, anxiety and all those other things that contribute to this occurring.''\\n  \\tDemetrio said the more players who allow their brains to be studied, the better. Seau's death might help others in the NFL think of the ramifications of head injuries on the field, he said.\\n  \\t''For the benefit of the players playing the game today, starting in peewee football all the way up, the more evidence that can be compiled,'' Demetrio said, ''the safer the game will be.''\"]"
